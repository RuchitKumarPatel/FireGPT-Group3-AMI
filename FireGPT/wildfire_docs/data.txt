A NASA sensor recently brought a new approach to battling wildfire, providing real-time data that helped firefighters in the field contain a blaze in Alabama. Called AVIRIS-3, which is short for Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer 3, the instrument detected a 120-acre fire on March 19 that had not yet been reported to officials.
As AVIRIS-3 flew aboard a King Air B200 research plane over the fire about 3 miles (5 kilometers) east of Castleberry, Alabama, a scientist on the plane analyzed the data in real time and identified where the blaze was burning most intensely. The information was then sent via satellite internet to fire officials and researchers on the ground, who distributed images showing the fire’s perimeter to firefighters’ phones in the field.
All told, the process from detection during the flyover to alert on handheld devices took a few minutes. In addition to pinpointing the location and extent of the fire, the data showed firefighters its perimeter, helping them gauge whether it was likely to spread and decide where to add personnel and equipment.
“This is very agile science,” said Robert Green, the AVIRIS program’s principal investigator and a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, noting AVIRIS-3 mapped the burn scar left near JPL by the Eaton Fire in January.
Observing the ground from about 9,000 feet (3,000 meters) in altitude, AVIRIS-3 flew aboard several test flights over Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas for a NASA 2025 FireSense Airborne Campaign. Researchers flew in the second half of March to prepare for prescribed burn experiments that took place in the Geneva State Forest in Alabama on March 28 and at Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia from April 14 to 20. During the March span, the AVIRIS-3 team mapped at least 13 wildfires and prescribed burns, as well as dozens of small hot spots (places where heat is especially intense) — all in real time.
Data from imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-3 typically takes days or weeks to be processed into highly detailed, multilayer image products used for research. By simplifying the calibration algorithms, researchers were able to process data on a computer aboard the plane in a fraction of the time it otherwise would have taken. Airborne satellite internet connectivity enabled the images to be distributed almost immediately, while the plane was still in flight, rather than after it landed.
The AVIRIS team generated its first real-time products during a February campaign covering parts of Panama and Costa Rica, and they have continued to improve the process, automating the mapping steps aboard the plane.
‘Fan Favorite’
The AVIRIS-3 sensor belongs to a line of imaging spectrometers built at JPL since 1986. The instruments have been used to study a wide range of phenomena — including fire — by measuring sunlight reflecting from the planet’s surface.
During the March flights, researchers created three types of maps. One, called the Fire Quicklook, combines brightness measurements at three wavelengths of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, to identify the relative intensity of burning. Orange and red areas on the Fire Quicklook map show cooler-burning areas, while yellow indicates the most intense flames. Previously burned areas show up as dark red or brown.
Another map type, the Fire 2400 nm Quicklook, looks solely at infrared light at a wavelength of 2,400 nanometers. The images are particularly useful for seeing hot spots and the perimeters of fires, which show brightly against a red background.
A third type of map, called just Quicklook, shows burned areas and smoke.
The Fire 2400 nm Quicklook was the “fan favorite” among the fire crews, said Ethan Barrett, fire analyst for the Forest Protection Division of the Alabama Forestry Commission. Seeing the outline of a wildfire from above helped Alabama Forestry Commission firefighters determine where to send bulldozers to stop the spread. 
Additionally, FireSense personnel analyzed the AVIRIS-3 imagery to create digitized perimeters of the fires. This provided firefighters fast, comprehensive intelligence of the situation on the ground.
That’s what happened with the Castleberry Fire. Having a clear picture of where it was burning most intensely enabled firefighters to focus on where they could make a difference — on the northeastern edge. 
Then, two days after identifying Castleberry Fire hot spots, the sensor spotted a fire about 4 miles (2.5 kilometers) southwest of Perdido, Alabama. As forestry officials worked to prevent flames from reaching six nearby buildings, they noticed that the fire’s main hot spot was inside the perimeter and contained. With that intelligence, they decided to shift some resources to fires 25 miles (40 kilometers) away near Mount Vernon, Alabama.
To combat one of the Mount Vernon fires, crews used AVIRIS-3 maps to determine where to establish fire breaks beyond the northwestern end of the fire. They ultimately cut the blaze off within about 100 feet (30 meters) of four buildings. 
“Fire moves a lot faster than a bulldozer, so we have to try to get around it before it overtakes us. These maps show us the hot spots,” Barrett said. “When I get out of the truck, I can say, ‘OK, here’s the perimeter.’ That puts me light-years ahead.”
AVIRIS and the Firesense Airborne Campaign are part of NASA’s work to leverage its expertise to combat wildfires using solutions including airborne technologies. The agency also recently demonstrated a prototype from its Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations project that will provide reliable airspace management for drones and other aircraft operating in the air above wildfires.

Wildfires, a natural part of the wildland life cycle, are experiencing a decades-long trend of increased frequency, duration, and magnitude, resulting in increased risk of fatalities and property damage. Fire suppression methods are adapting accordingly, including the increased use of aerial firefighting. Aerial firefighting, conducted in coordination with ground crews, provides real-time reconnaissance of a wildfire and performs strategic drops of retardant to contain and/or suppress the fire. These flight operations require airport and air traffic control infrastructure. The purpose of this report is to provide statistics on the U.S. aerial firefighting fleet, flight operations, and airport utilization and equipment in 2024. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers. Thirty-four (34) Very Large/Large Air Tankers (VLAT/LATs) were under contract with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) in 2024. The aircraft, ranging in age from 27 to 57 years, performed 11,219 retardant drop and reposition flights. Flights operated on 88% of the days with an average of 35 flights per day and a maximum of 200 flights per day. The number of flights per aircraft across the fleet was not uniform (average 288 flights, max 465 flights). Consistent with firefighting practices, the flights operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), mostly in the afternoons, with an average retardant drop flight duration of 34 min. Two hundred and seven (207) airports supported at least one departure, with 14 airports supporting 50% of the departures. Eighty-six (86%) percent of the airports were towered and 84% had precision approach procedures. All but two military airports were public airports that are part of the National Plan for Integrated Airport System (NPIAS) and eligible for Airport Improvement Plan (AIP) funding. Runway length and weight bearing are limitations at several airports. Furthermore, operations are no longer limited to airports west of the Rockies, with increased operations in the mid-west and east coast.
Wildfires are a natural and essential part of the wildland life cycle and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and promoting biodiversity. Wildfires in the United States, however, have become more frequent due to prolonged droughts [1] and the expanded human development in fire-prone regions [2]. Over the past several decades, rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns have intensified fire conditions, leading to extended fire seasons that now last several months longer than in previous decades [3]. The number of large wildfires, particularly megafires exceeding 100,000 acres, has increased since the early 2000s [4].
In response to these trends, wildfire management has evolved through technological advancements and strategic policy changes. For example, remote sensing and satellite imagery now play a crucial role in monitoring fire-prone areas [5], and artificial intelligence and predictive modeling have been integrated into fire forecasting [6].
Aerial firefighting has also undergone significant advancements to support ground crew operations with wildfire containment suppression efforts. Helicopters are equipped with precision water-dropping systems and infrared cameras to provide real-time situational awareness, enabling better coordination with ground crews [7]. Night-flying aircraft and drones have also been introduced to conduct suppression efforts around the clock, helping to contain fires in their early stages when visibility is typically reduced for traditional firefighting operations [8].
Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs) and Large Air Tankers (LATs) increasingly play a critical role in the initial attack, establishing containment lines, and suppression [9,10,11]. With their range and speed, VLATs and LATs provide rapid response to wildfires in remote locations and/or rugged terrain. VLATs, such as DC-10s, carry up to 10,000 gallons of retardant and drop approximately a one-mile containment line (depending on conditions). LATs, such as MD-87, 737, BAE 146, and C-130 s, carry between 3000 and 4000 gallons of retardant, and drop a 1/3 mile containment line.
VLAT and LAT operations are supported by a network of airports, designated as air tanker bases, that have the necessary infrastructure to support these operations [12].
This paper provides statistics on VLAT and LAT aerial firefighting operations and the demands on airports in the U.S. in 2024. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers.

3. Results
In 2024, there were 887 air tanker mobilizations [13]. This is the median mobilization account over the last 10 years. A detailed analysis of fleet characteristics, flight operations, airport operations, and airport characteristics was conducted in 2024.
3.1. Fleet Characteristics
The 2024 the MATOC fleet was composed of 34 aircraft (Table 2). There were 16 BAE–146 class vehicles with a retardant capacity of 3000 gallons, 14 vehicles with a 4000-gallon capacity (737, DC-9, and C-130), and 4 DC-10s’ that had a retardant capacity of 9400 gallons. The C-130s load retardant via pre-filled roll-on tanks to reduce retardant loading times. The other vehicles load retardant through flow (i.e., batch loading pumps or gravity feed).
The fleet is an aging fleet (Figure 2). The oldest aircraft, the C-130s, are 57 years old since the date of manufacture. The newest aircraft, RJ85A, is 25 years old since the date of manufacture. The number of aircraft is equally split above and below the mean age of 33.5 years and a median age of 34 years.
3.2. Flight Operations
Analysis of flight operations was conducted for 2024.
3.2.1. Overall Flight Operations
An estimated total of 11,219 flights were conducted during this period. Twelve percent (12%) percent of the days during this period did not have flights. These days include days when there were no active wildfires, or days with an active wildfire, but VLATS/LATS were not dispatched. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the days had at least one VLAT/LAT flight.
3.2.2. Flights per Day
Of the days in which the VLATS/LATS were active (Figure 3), the maximum number of flights per day was 200 (26 July 2024, Camp Fire). The median number of flights per day was 22 with an average of 43 flights per day. The standard deviation was 43 flights per day. There were 21 days in which the number of flights exceeded 2σ (121 flights per day) and 11 days in which the number of flights exceeded 3σ (11 flights per day).
Ranked flights per day exhibit a power curve distribution. Thirty-one (31) percent of the days had more than 50 VLAT/LAT flights. Fourteen (14) percent of the days had more than 100 flights.
Retardant drop flights occurred on every day in which the VLATS/LATS were active. On one day, across the fleet, there were as many as 157 retardant drop flights. The average number of retardant drop flights per day is 22, with a median of 8. On 45% percent of the days when the VLATS/LATS were active, there were less than five retardant drop flights per day.
Repositioning flights occurred on every day in which the VLATS/LATS were active. On one day, across the fleet, there were as many as 63 repositioning flights. The average number of repositioning flights per day is 10, with a median of 5. Note repositioning flights includes flights for maintenance purposes.
3.2.3. Flights by Tail Number
The number of flights by tail number ranged from 465 to 1. The average number of flights by tail number was 288 in total, with a median of 319 flights (Figure 4). The distribution of flights by tail number is asymmetric with a slight left tail. Fifty-eight (58) percent of the tail numbers operated more than the median number of flights during the period.
3.2.4. Flight Departure Time of Day
Consistent with aerial firefighting practices, VLAT/LAT flights operate under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The VLAT/LAT flights departed predominantly during daylight hours (Figure 5). The majority of both retardant drop and repositioning flights (>60%) departed after noon local time.
3.2.5. Flight Duration
Retardant drop flights exhibited wheels-off to wheels-on times with a mean of 38 min (estimated 220 miles) and median of 34 min (estimated 200 miles) roundtrip (Figure 6). These times include transit to the drop zone, loiter, drop, and then transit from the drop zone to the base.
3.2.6. Ramp Turn-Around Time for Retardant Drop Flights
Ramp turn-around time for retardant drop flights is measured from wheels-on to wheels-off for sequential retardant drop flights on the same day. This includes time at the retardant pit as well as time to and from the pit including departure queueing and ramp congestion. The estimated retardant loading time is 30–45 min for the DC-10 and 20–30 min for the 737, DC-9, and Avro 146. These times are reflected in the ramp turn-around time distribution: mean 36 min, median 25 min. Ten (10) percent of the flights exceeded 40 min turn-around time which may be the result of dispatch instructions as well as ramp congestion and departure queueing delays.
3.3. Airport Operations
The MATOC 2024 fleet departed from 207 airports (Figure 7). One-hundred and five (105) airports have five or more departures. Fifty (50) airports supported 90% of the departures. Fourteen (14) airports supported 50% of the departures (Table 3).
Two airports used are military airports: Fort Huachuca/Sierra Vista, Arizona (Army) and Hill Air Force Base—Ogden Utah. The remaining airports are all publicly owned and part of the National Plan for Integrated Airports (NPIAS).
Eighty-four (84) percent of the airports used had two or more runways.
For the longest runway at each airport, the median runway length is 9000′ and the mean is 9127′ (Figure 8). The shortest length of the longest runway is 5060′ (KPTV—Porterville, California) with the longest 13,503′ (KMWH—Grant County Intl Moses Lake, WA, USA).
The lowest airport elevation is sea level 46′ (KCRP—Corpus Christi, Texas), and the highest elevation is 6187′ (KCOS—Colorado Springs, Colorado). The mean and median elevation is 2872′.
The distribution of runway weight bearing for dual-tandem landing gears of VLATS and LATS has a median of 270,000 lbs and a mean of 372,000 lbs. To support VLATS and LATS operations, many airports provide a waiver. Thirty-six (36) percent of the airports used by VLATS and LATS in the 2024 fire season did not have a Pavement Classification Number (PCN) classification. The median PCN is 60 with a mean PCN of 53. The PCN is another way of assessing the weight-bearing capacity of airport runways. PCN is a standardized method to quantify the structural strength of an airport’s runway, taxiway, or other pavements, ensuring that aircraft operate safely without compromising infrastructure integrity.
Eighty-six (86) percent of the airports used by VLATS and LATS in the 2024 fire season had a control tower. Many of the most used airports were non-towered: KCOE (Coeur d’Alene, Idaho), KINW (Winslow, Arizona), KLGD (La Grande, Oregon)—3.6% of flights, KPTV (Porterville, California), KPRB (Paso Robles, California), and KMYL (McCall, Idaho).
Airports supporting VLATS and LATS operations in the 2024 fire season all supported precision approach procedures: RNAV (GPS)—89%, ILS—83%, VOR, VOR-DME, VORTAC—80%, RNAV (RNP)—44%, GPS—6%, and Published Visual—4%.
4. Discussion
The section discusses the implications of the above statistical findings.
4.1. Fleet Age and Part Obsolescence
The existing VLAT/LAT fleet is an aged fleet (mean 33 years, max 57 years). As the aircraft age, part obsolescence is a growing problem resulting in increased maintenance costs.
Unlike commercial airliners, which benefit from large-scale manufacturing, the niche market for specifically designed aerial firefighting aircraft makes it difficult to achieve economies of scale, leading to high per-unit costs [14]. Barring government subsidies or changes in the economics of aerial firefighting, a clean-sheet design of VLAT/LAT is unlikely. Due to these economics, the industry is obliged to rely on converting the existing commercial and military aircraft rather than investing in purpose-built designs.
One of the ways to address this issue is to enable the sale of the Department of Defense’s excess aircraft for aerial firefighting purposes (e.g., the U.S. Congress has a bill pending -the Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act of 2025).
4.2. Fleet Size and Availability
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires have raised concerns about the size of the fleet to meet operational wildfire demands [15]. For example, in 2024, the National Interagency Coordination Center Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics Annual Report [11] identified that 16% of air tanker mobilization requests were “Unable to Fulfill (UTF)”. Although the request process is complex and there are many reasons for UTF, the statistics suggest a shortfall even though the 2024 fire season was relatively low.
The primary factor determining the privately owner VLAT/LAT fleet size in the U.S. is the government contracting mechanism. The U.S. Forest Service employs two primary contracting mechanisms to manage its fleet of Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs) and Large Air Tankers (LATs): Exclusive-Use (EU) contracts and Call-When-Needed (CWN) contracts [13].
EU contracts provide guaranteed availability of aircraft for a specified period, ensuring that tankers are readily accessible during peak wildfire seasons. In contrast, CWN contracts allow the agency to request aircraft on an as-needed basis (if they are available).
While CWN contracts offer flexibility and cost savings to the government during periods of low fire activity, they present challenges with regard to fleet expansion and readiness. CWN contracts shift the financial risk to private service providers who must maintain readiness without assured deployment. Service providers under CWN agreements may face financial uncertainties due to the lack of guaranteed income, potentially leading to reduced investment in aircraft maintenance or acquisition. This situation can also result in the limited availability of air tankers when demand surges. For instance, in 2021, the Forest Service aimed to activate 16 CWN air tankers but could only secure five. The other tankers were contracted out overseas [16].
Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission [2] has called for an evaluation of alternate VLAT/LAT ownership models: government vs. private-owned aviation assets. Furthermore, the commission called for developing a strategic framework and national performance measures in order to determine the appropriate or optimal number of aircraft.
Another option is to pool resources among countries [17]. A fleet could be managed by an appropriate United Nations office and funded by international contributions. In the event of any wildfire emergency, a subscribing member nation would have optional recourse to this fleet operated in coordination with their own national/state fire agencies.
4.3. Flight Operations
Daylight operations are consistent with wildfire fighting protocols and the nature of VLAT/LAT retardant drops. Retardant drops require VLATs and LATs to fly at low altitudes, often in rugged terrain, under the guidance of spotter aircraft. These precise maneuvers require maintaining visual contact with the ground and surrounding area and would naturally require Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Also, fires generally behave differently at night due to lower temperatures, potentially making large-scale drops less necessary compared to the intense fire behavior seen during the day.
4.4. Airport Operations and Characteristics
Airports that are used are determined by their proximity to the wildfires and their available capabilities. Particularly, west of the Rocky Mountains, airports with appropriate capabilities are within range of the location of the fires. However, there are questions about the geographic proximity and airport capabilities in other regions of the country. Notably, in 2024, there were airports used east of the Rocky Mountains that have traditionally not supported aerial fire-fighting operations: Maine, Louisiana, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
4.5. Runway Length, Temperature and Retardant Capacity
The relationship between runway length, temperature, and density altitude is particularly important for aircraft departing at or close to maximum takeoff weight. Aircraft rely on the density of the air to generate lift and thrust. At higher elevations, the air density decreases, so at high elevations, the engines produce less thrust, and the wings generate less lift. The result is that aircraft need more runway length to achieve the necessary speed for takeoff or landing in thinner air because they require a longer distance to generate enough lift. A general rule of thumb is that for every 1000 feet of elevation above sea level, an airport generally requires about 5% to 10% more runway length to account for the reduced air density. Temperature is also a factor. Warmer air is also less dense than cooler air, so high temperatures (especially in summer) can have a similar effect to high altitude, requiring longer runways.
Runway length at airports at higher elevations during the summer months has been identified as an issue for the VLATS/LATS. In 2024, an estimated 5% of the flights at higher elevations airports were dispatched with up to 20% less retardant to account for temperature, elevation, and runway length.
For the top airports supporting aerial fire-fighting operations, the higher-elevation airports did not necessarily have the longest runways (Figure 9). In fact, several of the most used airports at higher elevations were the airports that experienced “downloading”: Winslow (KINW), Prescott (KPRC), Silver City (KSCV), Rimona (KRNM), Porterville (KPTV), and McCall (KMYL).
4.6. Runway Weight Bearing
For air tankers, runway weight bearing is important as these aircraft carry significant weight when loaded with large amounts of retardant. Runways must be designed to handle these heavy loads to prevent runway damage, ensure safe takeoffs and landings, and maintain the overall safety and performance of the air tanker operations. Continuous high-frequency operations may lead to structural degradation. Many airports operated under waivers regarding weight-bearing capacity.
4.7. Airport Navigation Aides
Navigation aids for precision approaches are useful for VLAT/LAT operations. Although flights predominantly operate under VMC, there are scenarios in which the drop zone is VMS but the airport may experience reduced visibility due to smoke or low ceilings.
4.8. Ramp Congestion
Increased cargo and general aviation operations at air tanker airports have contributed to ramp congestion, which impacts turnaround times and operational efficiency.
4.9. Retardant Safety
Modern fire retardants are designed to be highly effective in wildfire suppression. The primary active ingredient in long-term fire retardants is ammonium phosphate, a compound widely used in agriculture. Once applied, fire retardant remains effective until it is removed by significant rainfall, at which point it breaks down and can act as a fertilizer for vegetation. To minimize any potential environmental impact, application guidelines include designated avoidance areas near waterways and sensitive habitats.
Fire retardants approved by the USFS do not contain intentionally added pre- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or other persistent chemicals, and the red color commonly seen in aerial drops comes from a fugitive dye that fades over time with UV exposure. This color helps ensure precise application, reducing redundant drops and improving efficiency.
4.10. Retardant Availability
A critical issue is ensuring that fire retardants are available at the right place and time to support aerial firefighting operations. An intricate supply chain infrastructure plays a vital role in the overall success of wildfire containment strategies The logistical complexity of this effort requires a strategic, multi-layered infrastructure to adapt to rapidly evolving fire conditions. To meet the demand, a network of multiple manufacturing and distribution centers are located across the U.S.
The logistical challenges of wildfire response require real-time coordination between manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and frontline firefighting operations. Due to the unpredictability of wildfires, fire retardants cannot be stockpiled indiscriminately but must be strategically positioned for rapid deployment. Logistics teams must work around the clock to navigate transportation constraints, fluctuating fire behavior, and limited trucking capacity, ensuring that supplies reach critical locations without delay.
4.11. Water Availability for Retardant Loading
The availability of high-volume water sources was identified as a critical factor for efficient turnaround. Remote ramp space with easy access to water stands will be vital for sustaining LAT/VLAT operations in the future.
5. Conclusions
Wildfires are a key ecological process that maintains biodiversity and promotes ecological health in fire-prone regions. Nevertheless, when uncontrolled, wildfires can rapidly escalate, creating severe threats to ecosystems, human life, and infrastructure. The increasing frequency and intensity of these fires have led to a greater need for effective fire suppression strategies.
Over the past several decades, aerial firefighting has become an essential component of wildfire response, providing real-time reconnaissance and delivering strategic drops of fire retardant to suppress flames and protect threatened areas. However, these operations rely heavily on airport infrastructure and air traffic management systems to ensure efficient and safe deployment of firefighting resources.
This report provides a statistical analysis of the Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) and Large Air Tanker (LAT) fleets contracted under the USFS MATOC program for the 2024 fire season. Data include the number of aircraft, flight operations, and airport utilization, and key performance metrics such as aircraft age, operational tempo, and the impact of runway specifications on firefighting efficacy. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers.
The statistical results are dependent on the availability and accuracy of the data. Where possible, the data and results were verified by secondary sources and by subject matter experts.

Firefighting aircraft and helicopters: The flying fire brigade
Aircraft and helicopters can help battle wildfires quickly and effectively, with the choice of aircraft depending on the geography of the area. An overview.
Forest and bush fires have been around for as long as those landscapes have existed. But never before in recorded human history has our planet seen such widespread and intense wildfires. Since the summer of 2023, it’s been possible to scientifically quantify this trend. A team from the University of Tasmania used satellite data to analyze the energy of major fires between 2003 and 2023. They identified 2,913 extreme fires that between them released more energy than 99.99 percent of all the fires investigated during this period. Over time, the number of extreme fires rose from around 100 per year to more than 200. While the total energy of the 20 most serious fires in the first year was around 60,000 megawatts, 20 years later it was more than 130,000 megawatts. According to the study, fires have increased everywhere, but most notably in the Arctic and subarctic forests of the northern hemisphere and in the coniferous forests of temperate latitudes.
Best keep firefighting aircraft and helicopters ready for takeoff
This comes as no surprise to Alexander Held, Senior Expert at the European Forest Institute in Bonn, Germany. “Climate change is making extreme weather more frequent, leading to more extreme fires: increasing drought provides more and more fuel for forest fires, so they become hotter, bigger, and more intense.” This is making firefighting increasingly difficult. Especially in areas that are more difficult to access, or where there is an extreme danger of forest fires, firefighting aircraft and helicopters are the only option for a truly rapid first attack. To be able to get to the source of the fire as quickly as possible, it’s best to keep the aircraft parked on the runway, fueled and ready for takeoff. Better still is to have them already in the air on patrol.
Chemicals make the water gel-like, dyes make it visible
Whether in a firefighting aircraft or a firefighting helicopter, the crew can’t simply switch to autopilot. Where fire rages, hot air rises, meaning the flying firefighters often have to deal with bone-rattling turbulence. In addition, smoke and fumes impair their visibility. As a result, tragic accidents occur time and again, often with fatalities among the crew.
The aircraft take on water either at their home airport or on their way to fight the fire. The latter involves perilous maneuvers as pilots bring their firefighting aircraft into direct contact with the surface of a lake or the sea to literally scoop the water into their tanks. Helicopters hover over the water and drop their external tanks, which are usually suspended from ropes, down into the water.
As a rule, flying firefighters add chemicals to the water to give it a gel-like property that allows the water to adhere better to trees and bushes. Compounds based on ammonium phosphate deliver an additional cooling effect. Adding often brightly colored dyes helps pilots identify where water has already been dropped.
Virtual-reality training for aerial firefighting or rescue exercises
But without support on the ground, fighting wildfires from the air won’t achieve much. “The crucial thing is that, before anything else, we do our homework in fire management on the ground,” Held says. In commercial forests, that starts with the choice of tree – a key consideration. Resin-rich conifers, especially pines, burn particularly well. That’s why the owners of large pine forests often rely on firebreaks formed by poplars, robinia, or red oaks. Tracks through the forest that provide access for forestry machinery have a similar effect. But regardless of their preventive function, it’s essential to maintain these forest tracks. After all, if a fire does break out, the firefighters on the ground need to get to it as quickly as possible.
The surest path to containing a wildfire is when air and ground forces act in a coordinated manner. Which fires would require enormous effort to reach using hose lines and are therefore better fought from the air? When does it make sense to hastily cut new firebreaks in the forest? And exactly when and where should airborne firefighters drop their water? Any firefighters on the ground need time to withdraw so they can avoid the danger of trees toppling under the weight of the water being dropped from the air. If helicopters have filled their external tanks in shallow lakes or riverbeds, the water they dump out of the sky can contain stones.
Fighting fires with high tech: Modern approaches to managing wildfires
These days, cutting-edge technologies and innovations have become commonplace in forest firefighting. Infrared sensor technologies on drones – or, in remote areas, via satellite – enable the early detection of fires, often before the flames are visible to the human eye. AI and machine learning can help analyze and process large amounts of data, such as satellite photos, weather forecasts, or readings from temperature sensors distributed throughout the forest. These technologies help either in predicting the probability of fires or in correctly interpreting early warning signs. Once a fire has broken out, they help monitor its spread. Virtual-reality training also provides valuable assistance in aerial firefighting training, rescue exercises, and wildfire scenarios.
Overview of the different models:
McDonnel Douglas DC-10 Air Tanker
For many years, a converted Boeing 747-400 known as the Global Supertanker held the title of the biggest firefighting aircraft. However, when work began in 2021 to convert it into a “normal” freighter, it ceded this honor to the McDonnel Douglas DC-10 Air Tanker, a three-engine jet that can drop 45,000 liters of water or fire retardant per mission. While the Global Supertanker’s water tanks were housed within its fuselage, the DC-10 Air Tanker has special tanks under the fuselage. When necessary, its crew can release the entire load in just eight seconds. Alternatively, it can “lay” a water trail on the ground up to 1.6 kilometers long. To prevent the aircraft’s center of gravity from shifting abruptly when it releases its water, baffles divide the tanks into sectors that can then empty evenly.
Canadair CL-415
The Canadair CL-415 is probably the most spectacular firefighting aircraft in terms of how it takes on water: once in the air, it scoops the water into its 6,100-liter tanks in a touch-and-go maneuver on the water’s surface, with the amphibious aircraft reaching speeds of up to 90 knots (almost 167 km/h). Support floats fitted almost at the end of the wings prevent the wingtips from dipping into the water. The amphibious aircraft can scoop up 6,137 liters of water while flying over a body of water. Its predecessor model, the CL-215, is still in use. Deliveries of its successor model, the De Havilland Canadair 515, are set to commence in 2027.
Air Tractor AT-802F and PZL M-18 Dromader
For an unbeatable ratio of aircraft weight to transportable water load, only one aircraft comes into question: with an unladen weight of just 3,270 kilograms, the small Air Tractor AT-802F can carry a full 3,100 liters of water. This robust single-propeller two-seater also has no trouble landing on gravel or grass runways. The M-18 Dromader from Polish manufacturer PZL has similar qualities: a monoplane with comparable dimensions, capacity for 2,200 liters of water, and excellent low-speed capabilities.
Firefighting helicopters
Equipped with external water tanks, firefighting helicopters can release their load almost exactly over the fire. And that’s true for virtually any terrain, including narrow ravines that firefighting aircraft can’t fly through for safety reasons. Smaller helicopters such as the Airbus Helicopters H135 can carry about 500 liters of water. Equipped with Bambi Buckets, the NH-90 helicopters operated by the German Armed Forces can carry 2,000 liters. The Sikorsky CH-53, which is quite a lot larger, can also drop the largest volume: 5,000 liters.
Drones to fight forest fires
Fire departments could soon be using drones not only for surveillance but also directly for firefighting. This is the aim of a research project being conducted by research partners in the German state of Brandenburg, entitled “Pilot development and firefighting testing of a firefighting drone swarm for direct vegetation firefighting,” or PEELIKAN for short (an acronym derived from its full German name). Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), PEELIKAN’s first test flights took place at the end of 2024. According to the research partners, a seamless drone circuit could transport more than 140,000 liters of water per day to the scene of a fire. The drones are primarily intended for areas that are difficult to access or for forests that are strewn with munitions.

Airborne Campaigns
NASA’s FireSense Project conducts airborne observations over wildland fires and prescription burn areas to evaluate and test new instrumentation and collect both remotely-sensed and in situ data that can inform management decisions and improve fire models. The FireSense project is focused on four uses-cases to improve wildfire management. These include the measurement of pre-fire fuels conditions, active fire dynamics, post fire impacts and threats, as well as air quality forecasting, each co-developed with identified wildfire management agency stakeholders. FireSense has a recurring airborne component where the project tests and further develops capabilities and technologies for transfer to stakeholders. A larger airborne campaign will take place during year five of the project (2027-2028) to fully demonstrate the technology developed during FireSense.
Data from the FireSense campaigns will be stored in a FireSense data repository developed by FireSense Implementation Team members at NASA Langley. The platform supports storage for documents, text delimited files (csv), geospatial data (point/polygon, geotiff, netcdf, laz,), as well as providing password protection on a government system. This is the same data system that supports other NASA airborne campaigns, including the FIREX-AQ project.


A complete wildfire mapping system.
TACFI-RS tells you where the fire is, where the fire has been, and where it is going, all within 5 minutes of imaging.  Simply fly a TACFI-RS sensor on one or more aircraft, flip the power switch, and view automatically generated maps directly on your browser.
Designed as part of a USDA research grant, TACFI-RS solves many of the problems that have plagued previous wildfire sensing systems. For years, maps have taken hours or days to create, making them less useful for critical decision making. Dedicated aircraft had to be used for sensing, even if other aircraft were already flying over the fire. High expenses reserved sensors for only a handful of aircraft nationally, leading to a scarcity of data for all but the most important fires. TACFI-RS was designed ground-up to be different: real-time, collaborative, and ubiquitous.
TACFI-RS renders everything in 3D, utilizing real terrain maps and satellite imagery layers. Understand the geometry of the incident, and upload custom imagery layers for even more situational awareness.
Every part of the system was designed for global data collection. View the combined data of all sensors in your fleet, on one single map. Even if you operate in Alaska and Australia.
Fire intensity is easily seen using a color gradient. Lower intensity fire is shown in yellow, while higher intensity fire is shown in red. Automated classification provides precise and real-time detection.
Easily see what areas have been imaged and which are in the dark using coverage maps. Fly organic flight paths and supplement blind spots with deviation as needed
With time-aware imagery, TACFI-RS tells you which areas have never burned (transparent), are currently burning (gradient), and have burned out (black
Raw LWIR intensity data is available for direct viewing, and powering downstream technologies such as advanced predictive models.
TACFI-RS geolocates every sample and automatically characterizes fire intensity, providing vastly improved fidelity over existing satellite systems. By compressing all data to a common 10 meter grid, TACFI-RS allows for real-time transmission of data over narrow datalinks.


1. introduction
One of the key findings in forest firefighting is that firefighting crews on the ground using manual extinguishing techniques to supplement TLF
and water jetting are extremely effective in ensuring the continued success of the operation.
Firefighting crews fight ground fires, create wound strips, carry out
follow-up extinguishing work and prevent the spread of fire even without the support of fire engines.
In order to be able to use firefighting teams to independently, efficiently and self-sufficiently fight vegetation fires, the district of Aschaffenburg
has appropriate vegetation fire modules available. They are described in detail in the
document “Equipment”. If required, these can be transported logistically
unproblematically to the respective scene.
The strength of an independent firefighting team should be at least one group.

2. Self-sufficient firefighting team
At first glance, self-sufficient firefighting teams appear to be rather helpless
and inappropriate. However, in many forest fires around the world, they
bear the main burden of firefighting - and successfully so.
Self-sufficient firefighting crews cut aisles in suitable places,
use fire as a means of securing these aisles and check
large areas for possible fire islands, which are mainly caused by flying fires
2. self-sufficient firefighting team
Firefighting teams as a self-sufficient resource seem rather helpless
and inappropriate at first glance. However, in many forest fires around the world, they
bear the main burden of firefighting - and successfully so.
Self-sufficient firefighting crews cut aisles in suitable places,
use fire as a means of securing these aisles where necessary and check
large areas for possible fire islands, which can be caused mainly by flying fires
.
When fighting vegetation fires by self-sufficient firefighting teams, the
principle applies that fires are not extinguished, but primarily contained and
controlled. To this end, the self-sufficient units use natural aisles and/or
create wound strips, taking particular account of the forest fire behavior, the
vegetation and the topography, and thus contain the fire (see point
14.3). In doing so, they must recognize particular danger spots (e.g. slope roads, steep slopes, basins running into
, etc.) and avoid them.
Conclusion: A self-sufficient firefighting team can be used not only to contain a
vegetation fire, but also for property protection, for example
of housing estates or individual buildings.

3. equipment for a group
It has been explained in various lectures, training documents and treatises on vegetation fires
that good and
visible results can be achieved in firefighting with the use of appropriate tools. This is especially true where
extinguishing water is only available in limited quantities. Reasons for this can be, for example, a lack of
roads in large forest areas, or a lack of tankers and
fire engines (e.g. due to several parallel events in one region).
To ensure that firefighting can be carried out effectively and self-sufficiently,
the following tools and equipment for a firefighting team in
group strength have proven their worth and should always be available to the emergency services
:
- 02 forest fire/fire patches
- 02 US forestry shovels
- 02 water backpacks/backpack sprayers
- 01 chainsaw with accessories (such as cut protection leg warmers, head protection, tools,
spare chain, canister with fuel and saw chain adhesive oil)
The following
hand tools should also be available for applying wound strips and extinguishing fires:
- 02 pieces of flat hoes/forest fire axes (e.g. Pulaski axe)
- 02 Forest fire universal tool “GORGUI Master”
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 4 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
4. distribution of the operational equipment to a firefighting team
Depending on the aforementioned purpose, the squads of the firefighting team
(firefighting team) are put together or equipped with the following equipment:
Group leader (GF)  directs the E-site
Engineer (Ma)  Chainsaw or 1 water backpack
Detector (Me)  clearing away cut material or 1 firefighting brush
Attack squad (AT)  1 firefighting brush / 1 sand shovel
- To support an extinguishing attack
Water troop (WT)  1 water backpack / 1 Pulaski
- for fighting fire islands or fire nests
Hose unit (ST)  1 forest fire universal tool / 1 flat hoe
- for creating wound strips
The distribution of equipment to the individual squads is only an example.
The explicit distribution of the equipment or which and how much equipment is used
is determined by the unit or squad leader.
5. protective clothing for vegetation firefighting
Personal protective equipment is essential when firefighting teams are deployed. A balance must be struck here between optimum protection against brief contact with flames and flying sparks and the highest possible wearing comfort. Multi-layered outer clothing (fire protection clothing, e.g. in accordance with HuPF or EN 469) in particular can be very stressful for the wearer in warm weather. However, you should not work without outer clothing, as even light sparks can lead to injuries. It is best to wear long underwear and a single-layer turnout suit. However, each fire department must clarify whether the existing protective suits, e.g. Bayern 2000 or Oberstdorf, provide sufficient heat protection. In lightly smoky areas, a vegetation fire protection mask (Hot Shield) with an integrated particle filter and tight-fitting,
fog-free safety goggles should be worn to make work easier. This not only covers the open areas of skin, such as the throat, neck and large parts of the face, against flames, flying sparks and heat radiation, but also protects the respiratory tract against dust and soot particles thanks to the insertable particle filter. The goggles also protect the
emergency worker from flying sparks, smoke and heat radiation.
Exposed areas of skin (face, throat, neck) can also be protected by a flame protection hood or neck protection or, for longer operations, by a lightweight helmet with
helmet cloth. Breathing masks, on the other hand, should only be worn in extreme conditions in densely smoky areas. In the event of escape from the fire zone, a breathing mask with filter must be worn.
Protective gloves are also part of your personal equipment. Sun cream and insect repellent should also be available to the emergency services.
When using protective footwear, it is advisable to wear robust lace-up boots, especially in rough terrain
such as in the forest. The risk of twisting your ankle or injuring yourself
is reduced because the foot is tightly enclosed. As
firefighting also involves moving over burnt areas and embers, the
soles of the shoes must be heat-resistant and adequately secured.
Vegetation fire fighting basics Lkr. AB Page 5 of 20
Basics - Vegetation fire fighting
6 Additional equipment:
6.1 Warning device
In order to be able to warn each other in the event of sudden dangers
, every emergency worker should be equipped with a
signal whistle.
6.2 Drinking bottles
There is a risk of heat exhaustion during physical work in the vicinity of a fire.
Sufficient fluids must therefore be carried.
A corresponding number of drinking bottles
made of stainless steel with a capacity of 0.9 liters are available at
for this purpose.
They are fitted with a thermal sleeve and are stored in standard drinks crates
. The drinking bottles are kept at the catering component (volunteer
Hohl fire department).
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 6 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
6.3 Thermo bags (Thermo Bottle Bag)
The thermo bag is a bag for drinking bottles with a strong insulating effect. It keeps
drinks warm or cold for longer. In addition, the thermal cover protects the drinking bottles
from dirt, dust and dents. The thermal cover is made of polyester fabric with
insulating foam. The Thermo Bottle Bag is also equipped with an adjustable belt loop
and a fuel cap.
The cover can be used to store aluminum or stainless steel drinking bottles with a maximum capacity of 1.5 liters
or PET bottles with a capacity of 1 liter.
Vegetation firefighting basics Lkr. AB Page 7 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
7. catering
Due to the heavy physical strain of vegetation firefighting operations,
care must always be taken to ensure that emergency personnel drink enough fluids. Plenty should be drunk before
and during the operation to avoid dehydration
of the emergency personnel.
Fruit juice spritzers or water are the most suitable drinks here. Apple spritzer
has proved particularly effective.
Rule of thumb: Each emergency worker should drink one liter of liquid
(water) per hour, spread out over time.
An adequate supply of energy in the form of fruit, bread and sausage
(chocolate bars only in exceptional cases) is also immensely important during the operation.
8. personnel (firefighting team) and personnel replacement
Heavy equipment and helicopters are used to fight vegetation fires, especially forest fires
. The task of firefighting crews is
to extinguish ground fires (offensive firefighting) and to create
firebreaks and wound strips (defensive firefighting). They also carry out
follow-up extinguishing work and prevent the spread of fire through flying sparks without the support of fire engines
. This largely involves heavy
physical work. In order to protect the firefighting crews and
relieve their workload, sufficient firefighting and emergency personnel must be available to replenish
and be replaced regularly
The smooth interaction of the individual players, as well as sufficient
operational firefighting crews (firefighting personnel) for firefighting,
ultimately determine effective firefighting and rapid
extinguishing success.
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 8 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
9. safety rules
The following basic safety rules, which are based on operational and
exercise experience, should be known to all emergency personnel.
B (S)- Observation / safety posts
There should be an independent observer at each operational section who warns the deployed personnel
in the event of sudden
weather changes (wind) or the occurrence of fire islands. In order to be able to quickly
evacuate the endangered area in the event of a change of situation under difficult conditions, a clear
retreat signal should be agreed for all deployed emergency personnel. The observation
post must not be involved in firefighting measures or other work
so that the tasks described above can be carried out responsibly and
without restrictions. Furthermore, it is his task to ensure
communication with the section/operations management and to pass on important
information.
K- Ensure communication
Ensuring the connection to the incident command and guaranteeing
communication within the unit are extremely important in the event of vegetation fires. If
this cannot be guaranteed, there is a very high risk that the emergency services may be surprised by
sudden changes in the situation and may be endangered
as a result.
 R- Ensure return/rescue route
Each operational section should have a suitable, predetermined escape route
Rescue route. This must have a low fire load and be known to all emergency personnel.
Escape/rescue routes can be marked, for example, with flutter tape (tie small strips of
to trees or bushes) and should lead to a
safety zone.
 S- Set up a safety zone
A safety zone is an area in which the emergency services are safe from a fire without further
protective measures and a fire zone does not endanger the
emergency services. This can be a road, a parking lot, a rocky area,
a large forest clearing or a body of water. If necessary, this zone must be created by removing vegetation
. The safety zone in forest stands
should be at least one tree length, preferably twice the length of the adjacent vegetation
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 9 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
10. Firefighting with firefighting vehicles
Ground-based firefighting teams are generally supported by firefighting vehicles
. In principle, only all-terrain vehicles should be used.
The most important equipment features for use in rough terrain are
all-wheel drive, a vehicle that is as short as possible, ground clearance, low total weight and
low ground pressure as well as suitable tires (with variable air pressure if necessary). For
off-road use, anti-skid chains must be carried on the vehicles as additional
equipment. For fighting vegetation fires, further
equipment must be included in addition to the minimum equipment for the existing vehicle load at
. In addition to further water-carrying fittings, this also includes
hand tools (as listed in point XX) for at least one firefighting group.
It is advantageous if the fire engines have a "pump & roll function", with
which makes it possible to discharge extinguishing water while driving. In the early phase of
forest and wildfires, the available water quantities
must be used extremely efficiently. Especially when using mobile water tanks,
which only have a limited capacity, the optimum application
quantity must be coordinated
 The addition of wetting agents (the environmental compatibility should
be taken into account) can increase effectiveness and counteract the general lack
of extinguishing agents. Air
, compressed air foam and gelling agents are suitable for
securing objects and aisles. As most forest fires are ground fires
, nozzles with a spray jet are primarily used. The particularly good maneuverability even in difficult terrain is an advantage here
(e.g.
D-hoses and D-jet nozzles). In areas where open flames and glowing
components endanger the use of conventional hoses, rubberized
or water-permeable hoses can be used.
Only after the outer edge of the fire has been extinguished can the extinguishing of the
entire fire area be started using a fire engine. Before this
fire engine is positioned, care must be taken to ensure that the intended
standing area is completely extinguished. This prevents damage to the control
and supply lines.
During the operation, the vehicles must be positioned in such a way that an escape is possible if the direction of fire
changes. This means driving backwards towards the scene of the fire (see picture) so that escape can be made quickly in the event of danger. In addition,
care must be taken to ensure that parked vehicles do not obstruct the access of advancing
units.
Reverse up to the scene. Keep paths clear!
In the event of vegetation fires, the general rule is that traffic on the access and
exit areas of staging areas, water extraction points and deployment sites must
be avoided. It is advisable to define one-way traffic regulations for these areas
.
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 10 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
11. Aerial firefighting
Aerial forest firefighting can basically only be regarded as a supporting
measure for ground-based firefighting. Nevertheless, it is indispensable in the case of
large wildfires and is often the only way of fighting
them. Aircraft water jets are used primarily
to fight rapidly spreading fires. Areas contaminated with ammunition and difficult to
access, e.g. in alpine terrain, can also be reached with air support.
Spot water drops are used for targeted extinguishing. In
Germany, mainly helicopters of the police, the German Armed Forces or
private service providers (e.g. www.helialert.com) with special external load containers (ALB)
are used. In addition to the helicopter transport of extinguishing water, the transportation of crew and equipment also plays an important role in the alpine
regions.
A clear deployment strategy should be developed prior to helicopter deployment. This
must specify where the helicopters can refuel the ALB
and where they can target the sources of the fire. The plan must also show where
vehicles can be refueled and parked for breaks.
In order not to endanger the ground-based emergency services, the areas in which water can be dropped from the air must be clearly defined in advance
. During
an aerial firefighting operation, the target area must be cleared
by the firefighting teams.
If firefighting crews remain in the target area, they should not be wetted
if possible. The risk of falling branches or stones rolling down slopes with
is also increased by the helicopter.
When fighting fires from the air, colored extinguishing agent additives
can be used to mark the treated area.
Use of a helicopter with an external extinguishing water tank

12. Extinguishing water extraction points
When fighting forest fires, large quantities of extinguishing water must be made available away from supply facilities
. The maintenance, expansion and technical
improvement of a network of fire water extraction points is therefore particularly necessary in
fire-prone areas.
The density and water delivery capacity of the network is determined by local requirements
Extinguishing water points must be permanently marked and mapped, access routes must be maintained
and signposted.
Extinguishing water can be obtained from:
 natural bodies of water (if possible with access points safe for fire engines),
 cisterns,
 artificial ponds and wells.
Withdrawal of extinguishing water using TS
Vegetation fire fighting basics Lkr. AB Page 12 of 20
Basics - Vegetation fire fighting
13. Vegetation fire fighting strategies
In contrast to building fires, vegetation fire fighting (forest and
wildland fire fighting) is primarily aimed at preventing the fire
from spreading. The most important goal is to prevent the fire from spreading from the ground to
the treetops and thus triggering a full fire. In the rarest of cases
areas can be completely extinguished. The firefighting strategy is primarily
aimed at containing fires.
Hand tools are just as important as extinguishing water in direct and indirect vegetation firefighting and for
post-extinguishing work in rough terrain and far from paved paths,
. The use of hand tools is still applicable
for flame lengths
 of up to 1 m - fire intensity is low
- hand tools, e.g. fire patches, can be used for direct attacks
to control the fire
 1-3 m - fire is too intense
- Hand tools cannot be used for direct attacks. Firefighting with
hose lines and backpack sprayers. Create aisles with bulldozers.
Only flank/parallel attack, depending on the local flame length
 3m and greater - fire intensity high - extreme
- Extinguishing with hand tools no longer possible. Firefighting with
hose lines, fire engines and helicopters. Creation of
aisles with heavy clearing equipment. Because the flames are too high, a
direct attack is not possible. Due to the excessive danger to the emergency services,
only indirect firefighting is logical. In this case, there is a risk of a
full fire and thus also an increased risk of fire islands due to
flying fires. High rising hot air can carry sparks, e.g. from cones,
moss, charcoal or birch bark, far upwards and then ignite new fires up to
400 m in front of the fire front. In this way,
flying fires can also jump over wide hardwood bars.
13.1 Reconnaissance
In order to successfully fight a vegetation fire, a thorough reconnaissance of the situation is essential
. The operational priorities are set according to the
tactical priorities as follows:
1. protection of people
2. protection of animals
3. protection of structures (buildings, roads, supply lines)
4. protection of vegetation at risk of full fire or rapid burning
Furthermore, the type of fire (full, ground or
surface fire) as well as the arrangement and quantity of the available fuel, the geo-
or topographical features, main direction of spread, special features of the
terrain, access and escape options for fire engines, wind direction and any
expected changes play an important role in the reconnaissance. Conclusions about the fire can also be drawn from the observation of the smoke column
(already on the approach to the scene)
. The color and shape of the smoke column provide information on how the fire
is behaving. All this information is used during the operational planning phase to decide
how to fight the fire. A direct or indirect approach is possible when fighting
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 13 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
13.2 Locating deployment sites in non-signposted areas here
- Signage/marking for emergency vehicles -
Vegetation and forest fires are classic deployment scenarios in which it is difficult to reach
the deployment site due to a lack of orientation options such as
road signs, clear designations or similar. This poses considerable problems, especially for
non-local or following emergency services
.
It is therefore all the more important that the first arriving emergency services - be it the fire department
or the police - mark the approach to the scene. As a rule, this should be done by
signposts. However, as it may not be possible to do without the necessary emergency services in an emergency,
this is often omitted, which in turn leads to
the subsequent emergency services only being able to be directed to the
emergency site through intensive radio calls.
This is where the pilot and reconnaissance group comes into play, with the
option presented here of marking approaches in unsignposted areas,
. As every vehicle in the pilot and reconnaissance group carries traffic guidance cones
(traffic guidance cones in accordance with BAST TL Leitkegel), these can be used to mark the approach routes in a simple
and effective manner.
For this purpose, traffic cones are laid down at intersections and placed on the correct route to continue
in such a way that the tip points in the
correct direction of travel - similar to an arrow.
Direction of travel
Image: View from the driver's cab - easily recognizable for machine operators and unit leaders, the folded
traffic cone points in the direction to be traveled.
This simple route marking makes it possible to mark the correct approach route for the following
emergency services. By providing appropriate information
, this regulation can be passed on to supporting farmers or other emergency services
so that they can also follow this marking in the event of an emergency
Furthermore, this marking can be used not only to mark the direct approach to the scene of the fire,
but also any necessary one-way regulations, e.g. for shuttle traffic for
extinguishing water supply.

14 Tactics for firefighting
14.1 Direct vegetation firefighting
Common practice in firefighting is the direct attack of the fire front using
firefighting crews, fire engines, as well as airplanes and/or helicopters with
extinguishing water drops. 
The extinguishing attack against the wind direction on the fire tip
achieves the highest effectiveness, but is not without risk due to the difficult to assess
speed of spread. This method can only be used for low
flame heights. The risk to yourself is high if the
propagation speed and flame lengths are incorrectly assessed. Upcoming
winds and unmanageable terrain conditions can lead to
emergency crews being trapped by the fire. In addition, the firefighters are exposed to the
heat of the fire and the smoke.
For an example sketch of a direct firefighting setup with the equipment provided by the
vegetation fire modules in the district of Aschaffenburg, see
Appendix 1.
14.2 Indirect vegetation firefighting
If a direct attack is not possible because the flames are too high, areas
are fought indirectly. The fire should be stopped by creating firebreaks (wound strips) or using
existing fireproof barriers (roads, paths).
Firebreaks can be created at an early stage and enable straightened
containment lines. In addition to the positive effect of being able to work without exposure to heat and smoke
, this method also has disadvantages. These include the increased
workload and the risk to emergency crews working without visual contact with the fire line.
In addition, fires are quite capable of jumping over these
firebreaks and require monitoring of the
areas behind them. When fighting fires (both direct and indirect
), it is important to monitor the surrounding area in order to immediately extinguish any fire islands caused by flying sparks and flying fires
.
For an example sketch of the structure of an indirect firefighting operation with equipment from
the vegetation fire modules available in the district of Aschaffenburg, see
Appendix 2.
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 15 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
14.3 Creating and securing firebreaks
Creating firebreaks generally only makes sense if intensive
full fires are to be stopped. The immense human and
material resources required for this (clearing equipment, personnel, etc.) are in most cases used more effectively in an
offensive approach. Nonetheless, the application of firefighting equipment can always be considered Plan B
in order to ensure the success of the direct approach. Before setting up
, it is essential to consult with the responsible forestry officials and
forest owners. The firebreak is always created in two parts. It has
a vegetation-free wound strip and a
monitoring area behind it.
The wound strip / firebreak should be created in such a way that
the width corresponds to at least twice the height of the existing vegetation or the
length of the flame. The creation of firebreaks generally requires the use of large
equipment. Forestry and agricultural
machines (Fig. A and B) as well as bulldozers (Fig. C) or armored recovery vehicles (Fig. D and E)
of the German Federal Armed Forces can be used to help with soil wounding (uncovering the mineral soil)
Vegetation fire basics Lkr. AB Page 16 of 20
Basics - Vegetation firefighting
Firefighting crews
can also use hand tools to lay out the snow/wound strip in a predetermined sequence. The sequence
is again determined by the vegetation and the ground. As a rule, the
cutting tools (chainsaw, axe) are used first, followed by hoes (Pulaski, Gorgui-
multi-purpose tool, flat hoe), rakes (Gorgui multi-purpose tool, McLeod) and
shovels in various combinations.
If the conditions allow and the training is available, the side of the aisle/wound strip facing the
fire is set on fire in order to widen and secure the
aisle (pre-fire). In addition, the vegetation
between the fire line and the pre-fire can be set on fire to remove fuel from the fire line (backfire).
Pre-fire and counter-fire may only be set by specially trained
personnel.
As soon as the fire line has reached the wound strip, teams with
water backpacks, fire pans and shovels secure the path and check the
hinterland for fire islands. However, this may only be carried out if the
safety of the emergency services is definitely not at risk. A forest fire in full
extension can quickly “overrun” a wound strip or a firebreak and
thus trap emergency crews. Sudden winds, for example,
can also cause a previously “harmless fire” to suddenly take on a very high fire intensity and high
rate of spread, which can ultimately put emergency services at great
risk. For this reason, forest fires should never be fought from the
fire front. The following principle applies here: The fire is fought from a safe
anchor point (usually the origin of the fire) via the flanks.

Aircraft Operations / Aerial
Firefighting Air Operations
for and by the fire service
Foreword
According to media reports from spring 2021, the
last five years were the driest so far in Central
Europe in the last 2.100 years or so1
.
This has consequences for the forests and for the
hazardousness posed by fires therein.
In Germany, especially the forest fire years 2018 and
2019, but also the dry, warm and windy spring of
2020, necessitated extensive and joint operations of
ground forces together with aircraft of various
authorities and organisations.
The summer of 2021 confirmed this with numerous
parallel missions of various aircraft for human
rescue, reconnaissance and command support.
In a rapidly increasing use of aircraft (internationally
known as Aerial Firefighting or, more generally, air
operations, or "AirOps" for short), pilots in particular
have repeatedly criticised the highly divergent
knowledge and expectations regarding the use of
aircraft, that unnecessarily complicate the joint effort
or call its success into question.
In order to provide an initial description of the tactical
framework conditions and to illustrate technical
possibilities for aircraft operations in Germany, @fire
organised a workshop on wildland fire firefighting
using "AirOps" at Bad Homburg fire service in
February 2020. The working group on forest fires,
being part of the technical committee on deployment,
extinguishing agents and environment protection
(FA ELU) of the DFV, had as well received a
mandate from the DFV Presidium in 2019 to become
active in this area. Members of the forest fire working
group therefore also took part in this workshop and
gave presentations. Speakers and trainers with
experience in wildfire fighting came from France,
Spain and the USA.
The participants were a mixture of fire brigades,
ministries, state fire service schools and a wide
variety of agencies (police forces of the states,
federal police, federal armed forces and private
individuals) as well as aircraft pilots. This technical
recommendation was drawn up on the basis of the
results of this workshop on firefighting with "AirOps".
It is also based on:
• international agreements or standards, for
example
* from ICAO (International Civil Aviation
Organisation of the UN) on extinguishing
agent storage for external landing areas and
* on the categorization of aircraft performance.
• Experience gained from many operations in
countries that have many years of experience
with continuously adapted standards. In
particular the training centre of the French
forest fire specialists and pilots in Valabre
should be named.
• documents on handling aircraft from insurance
companies or the German Social Accident
Insurance (DGUV)
• international training literature
1. Introduction
Wildland fires in particular require the deployment of
various units, resources and organizations in the
sense of an "operation of combined forces". This
includes that aircraft are only one of many means of
intervention in these firefighting operations, but in
principle cannot be successful on their own.
However, similar situations can also arise in dynamic
other wide area incidents caused or influenced by
nature, such as those typical of heavy rainfall events
or flood disasters.
Depending on the task and availability
• drones
• helicopters
• fixed-wing aircraft
are used.
The use of aircraft in non-police emergency response
is internationally referred to as aerial firefighting or air
operations, abbreviated “AirOps”
. It encompasses
much more than just fighting fires from the air.
During incidents, support or assistance from abroad
or, for example, friendly foreign troops in Germany
can happen.
English technical terms in this context should
therefore be well known. In case of need it may also
be necessary to deploy units with sufficient linguistic
knowledge for communication purposes. At the latest
this happens when foreign-language units (for
example units from the EU civil protection mechanism
or rescEU mechanism) are called in or they are
already deployed in an area close to the border (for
example CH 47 of the Dutch Air Force) or due to their
own responsibilities (for example Blackhawk, Apache,
CH 47 or similar in case of a fire involving US military
training areas) In addition to reconnaissance and aerial photography
with aircraft, the use of aerial images for positional
information from remote sensing systems, for
example from satellites is possible. If required, these
data can be made available through official channels
via the Centre for Satellite Based Crisis
Communication (ZKI) within the German Aerospace
Centre (DLR).
Depending on the scope of the aircraft mission, a
more or less accompanying effort must be made. In
order to make planning easier, the classification of an
incident is made regarding the type and number of
aircraft deployed, cf. 3.1.
In order to be able to plan operations and
communication more easily and clearly aircraft must
be clearly identifiable in terms of their mission value.
For this purpose, they are categorized, cf. 3.2.
2 Deployment of Aircraft
2.1 Incident Command
An incident commander determines the basic
structure and designation of the operational sectors
as well as the sector-related communication for the
incident site.
The basic principles of FwDV 100 [German Fire
Service Regulation 100] or DV 100 in the event of a
disaster apply.
In the case of wildland fires, for example, the fire
service is always in charge of the incident.
In the event of a disaster, operational command is
transferred to the agency defined in the disaster
control laws of the federal states (e.g. the district
administrator).
However, the tactical operational command of units in
action should always be carried out by expert fire
service officers.
Aeronautical responsibility always lies with the
respective pilot in command (PIC) of each aircraft.In concrete terms, this means that the incident
commander may demand everything, but the pilot
may refuse a mission for aeronautical reasons.
Pilots always act on the instructions of the fire
service's incident commander or in consultation with
ground-based firefighting units. In the event of
imminent danger, pilots can carry out immediate
measures that cannot be postponed, which are then
immediately reported to incident command.
In case of larger or more complex (aeronautical)
situations, the sector commander (EAL) “Air”, in
coordination with the incident commander, can have
the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) establish a
restricted flight area (ED-R) above the scene of the
incident.
Please note the following:
• The request is first made by telephone via the fire
service's control center and then, in case of a
longer duration, in writing to the responsible
officer in charge at German Air Traffic Control
(DFS).
• The lead time is regularly assumed to be four
hours. Although the ED-R is set up immediately,
pilots must be informed of the set-up via the
"Notices to Airmen" (NOTAMs). Only then can
they be prosecuted for violations of the restricted
area.
• The dimensions (radius and altitude) of the ED-R
may be determined by the requesting unit in
consultation with DFS.
• A designation of aircraft to be used there may be
made in advance. The entry of official aircraft on
the basis of special regulations or special rights in
accordance with § 30 LuftVG [Air Traffic Act]
remains unaffected by this.
• The responsible state aviation authority or, if
applicable, the responsible police authority will
prosecute violations of the regulations concerning
the respective ED-R.
• The information of corresponding air sports clubs
in the vicinity of the incident site can be helpful to
prevent overflights in a very timely manner.
Nevertheless hobby pilots flying individually and, especially in
mountainous areas, paragliders etc. must be
expected.
2.1.1 Briefing of the units
Especially for aircraft operations, a safety briefing
(risks such as high-voltage power lines, wind turbines,
cable cars, etc.) is necessary in addition to the general
briefing (mission, landing site, water pick up points,
etc.)!
International linguistic usage for this is the so-called
"Safety Briefing".
In smaller situations this should be done by the first
approaching pilots. In larger situations, it must then be
continued by the operations manager or sector
commander for aircraft operations (in short: EAL Luft
[sector commander “air”]) in cooperation with other
incident sectors and aircraft pilots.
Aircraft mission may include
• reconnaissance (size up)
• command support
• extinguishing
• transport
Units on the ground must also be informed of aircraft
deployed. This is mandatory for all units in drop zones
or areas designated for off-airfield landings, for
example.
2.1.2 Cartography/location information
Pilots today consistently work with GPS coordinates
based on the World Geodetic System 1984 - WGS 84. To avoid errors, only WGS-84 coordinates should
be used in communication with the aircraft. Other
coordinate formats such as UTM [UTMREF] must
be converted beforehand.
Example
UTM: 32U PD 02529 17187
Correct: GPS: N 52° 29,709 E 010° 30,615
Wrong: N 52,49517 E 10,51025 (“Google format”).
If other coordinate formats are used, all aircraft
involved in this mission must be able to use them
to avoid misunderstandings.
The north direction and classification of maps or
position sketches must be clearly defined and shall be
always available in order to be able to react
unambiguously to changes (e.g. changes in wind
direction and strength).
The designation of the sides of the fire is to be made
unambiguously and, as a rule, according to the
direction of fire spread, for example, according to the
wind direction, cf. fig. 2.1.3/1.
2.1.3 Anatomy of Wildland Fires
For communication between units, but especially
between ground and air units, a common language
must be spoken for orientation regarding the fire
situation.
The basis for this is always the direction of fire
spread, as the location in the map system can
change with alternating wind directions! 2.2 Communication
For communication, the following technical
possibilities are basically available, which are mostly
bound to the respective operator. Basically, of course,
BOS radio is only safely available in aircraft of the
following authorities:
• Police forces of the federal states
• Federal police
• Rescue and civil defense helicopters
• German Armed Forces (note: not all, but only a
few types, such as those used in rescue and SAR
missions).
It is imperative to take this into account when planning
communications, depending on the units involved.
In case of doubt, suitable communication interfaces
must be planned and organized in good time!
1. BOS digital radio [TETRA 25] in TMO (network)
or DMO (direct) operational mode: The advantage
of digital radio, in addition to the intended area-wide
coverage among fire brigades and many BOS
operators, is the greater range due to the network operational mode. The
disadvantage of TMO mode is the high latency, which
is too high for safety-critical applications (e.g. height
of a load above ground). In DMO mode, the latency
problem is reduced. Although DMO mode is more
suitable in these cases compared to TMO mode, it is
not optimum. In addition, the range near the ground is
limited to only a few kilometers. With aircraft,
however, the range can be many kilometers and thus
interfere with other radio circuits!
Private operators usually do not have these radios
(official acknowledgement as an organization working
in disaster management required) and are not allowed
to use them.
In supra-local operations beyond federal state
borders, problems may arise with the available digital
radio groups.
2 Analog BOS radio: This will have been replaced by
digital BOS radio in most aircraft by 2021. However, it
should be noted that digital BOS radio is still not
available for all ground units (and not for all command
vehicles) throughout Germany.
3. Aeronautical radio: The advantage of aeronautical
radio lies in the minimal latency and the general
availability in aircraft, with the disadvantage of the low
range and the very rare availability for fire brigades
(currently practically only for the Bavarian Fire Service
Air Support units) and the requirements for the
operation of such radios, which must be registered
and approved by the Federal Network Agency.
Furthermore, the special legal regulations must be
observed during operation and the necessary training
and advanced training must be carried out.
4. Private Operational Radio: In addition to aircraft
radio, private aircraft operators usually have their own
operational radio, which allows communication with
the ground, provided that appropriate equipment is
available there, for example by flight assistant
personnel of the operating agencies.
Communication between aircraft and ground units
must be technically and organizationally ensured at all
times. The usable or available groups in digital radio
should be determined in advance. Fleet mapping must be adapted accordingly. In Bavaria, the digital
radio groups named "Luft Bayern Nord" [Air Northern
Bavaria] and "Air Bavaria South" [Air Southern
Bavaria] are available for Bavarian Fire Service Air
Support units. Radios of other BOS members
(especially aircraft) should be programmed
accordingly. If this is not possible, the digital radios
must be programmed for TBZ groups, for other radios
(for example, aircraft radio) or interfaces between the
organizations involved.
If aircraft do not have a BOS radio (such as the larger
types of Bundeswehr [German Federal Army] aircraft,
aircraft of private operators and foreign troops), or the
ground forces do not have digital radio that is
compatible with that of the BOS helicopters
(grouping), then aeronautical radio must be used.
In this case, aeronautical radio must also be available
and operable on the ground at the incident site and
must be able and permitted to be operated. If this is
not ensured by the requesting unit, it should be
ensured by the (or by a) flying organization.
Therefore, multi-channel or group communication with
different radios or radio groups can currently happen.
With conceptual integration of the helicopters of the
state police forces as well as the federal police into
wildland fire fighting concepts of the federal states, the
use of digital radio is becoming increasingly important.
Bavaria in addition uses radios for communication
between Bavarian Fire Service Air Support units with
PTT2 communication via special radios for the flight
support units (usually with special helmets). If these
units are mobilized in other federal states the interface
is guaranteed via the officer in charge of the flight
support units.
Preplanning of the means of communications makes
sense and can be done using templates usually
available in the federal states or fire service schools.Thereby overviews can be easily prepared and then
can be simply completed in the field, cf. appendix.
The less pre-planning there is, the more effort is
required for spontaneous planning in the field. The S6
function [information & communication] as part of the
command staff is ideal to be used for this purpose. It
is advisable to define appropriate communication and
operational plans in advance.
2.3 Safe cooperation during operations:
Air - Ground
2.3.1 Safe aircraft operations on the ground
In contrast to operations taking place at airports, there
is no infrastructure available on the incident site, but
loose objects lying around (bags, tarpaulins,
branches), for example, can endanger landing or
taking-off aircraft or responding forces on the ground.
In order to operate field landing sites, incident
command therefore ensures the following, for
example in accordance with DGUV information 214-
911 [Safe operations of helicopters in aerial work]:
• Landing zones and takeoff areas of aircraft must
be kept clear and, if possible, secured against
unauthorized entry.
• Safety areas and unambiguous procedures for
approaching aircraft must be agreed with the
pilots.
• Loose material shall be removed or secured.
• Dusty surfaces are to be avoided, removed or
wetted with water.
• The touchdown surface must be as level as
possible.
• Outdoor field landing areas shall be located
sufficiently far from residential buildings and other
obstacles (bridges, overhead power lines).
• A clearly recognizable device for identifying the
wind direction should be installed (e.g. windsock
on a pole).
• An absolute ban on smoking is to be imposed and
enforced. • For self-protection, suitable fire protection and
sufficient first aid equipment must be provided on
site. As a rule, the relevant emergency personnel
must be able to use PPE 14 according to DGUV
Information 205-016 (overgarments for internal
attack/compartment fire fighting). The following is
an example of how this can easily be done in the
area of operation with standardized fire service
appliances.
Note: The appropriate equipment for fire-fighting or
technical assistance depends on the aircraft used or
landing3. The following table 1 shows examples of
standardized vehicles that roughly correspond to the
ICAO guidelines, based on the helicopter category (or
class) according to ICAO4
.
Of course, an assistance component - for example, a
HLF [Group pumping appliance for rescue operations]
- is also useful.
If only individual landings - and these at different
locations - are planned or carried out in the area of
operations, e.g. to pick up an air observer, these are
not categorized as planned external (field) landing
areas. For the operation of load pick-up and drop-down sites,
incident command will ensure, in accordance with
DGUV Information 214-911, for example, the
following:
• Selected places, including the necessary
approach and departure areas, must be
sufficiently large and cleared.
• For approaching and working under the aircraft,
safety areas and clear procedures must be
agreed with the pilots.
• The load pick-up and drop-down area must be
designed separately from the outer landing area!
A minimum distance is to be agreed with the pilots
and depending on the aircraft used. When
necessary, this area has to be adjusted.
• Only appropriately trained or instructed personnel
should be present in the load pick-up zone.
• Loose material is to be removed or fixed if
possible.
• Dusty ground is to be avoided.
• Necessary traffic securing measures of affected
public traffic route networks are to be taken.
This also applies, of course, to the dropping-off of
loads via winches or load hooks with ropes. In the case of larger or more complex missions
involving aircraft, the following must be observed
wherever possible in advance, but at the latest during
the safety briefing of the pilots in consultation with the
crews:
• Places or zones for emergency jettisoning of
external loads
• emergency landing area (e.g. on a mountain) or
possibilities for this (e.g. in extensive forest areas)
These are to be discussed during the general briefing
and shall be kept free from other responding units. In
particular, the area used for preplanned fire and
rescue operations around and within the external
loading zones must be known to all responding units.
Emergency landing areas must also be made known
to all other responding forces. They must also be
noted on situation maps. If the situation changes, they
may have to be relocated and the information or
situation maps adapted accordingly.
In the case of larger or longer missions, the EAL Air,
in consultation with the operators of the aircraft, must
check whether a field refueling station can make flight
operations more efficient.
This is always the case when the nearest suitable
airport with regular refueling facilities is too far away
to be reached within a few minutes of flight time.
The following applies to the establishment of a field
refueling site:
• Safety distance of > 10 m between built-up area
and refueling facility.
• Safety distance > 5 m between the outside of the
rotor or the tail of the helicopter and the refueling
station.
• For self-protection, suitable fire protection and
sufficient first aid equipment must be available on
site. (Note: A [tank, water tender] fire engine with
at least 4000 L of water and foam concentrate is
sufficient for this purpose, ideally a PTLF 4000 or
comparable type of appliance). If the field
refueling station is identical with or in the immediate vicinity of the outdoor field landing
area, fire engines that are pre-planned for the landing
area can also be used for the refueling point.
The officer in charge of this unit is to be informed
accordingly and must ensure that field refueling can
be performed safely. Depending on the surface or
accessibility of the terrain suitability of the appliances
must be checked in advance and covered by selecting
suitable vehicles.
• Drip pans and drip mats as well as collecting- and
binding facilities for small quantities of fuel [e.g. oil
spills / fuel spills] should be provided.
2.3.2 Safety on the ground during
aerial fire-fighting operations
Approach and departure areas with external load
containers [buckets] should not be located over
populated areas. This reduces risks and facilitates
emergency drop-offs.
In particular, landing and taking-off helicopters
generate a powerful airflow (down- and sidewash).
This can stir up loose debris, throw it through the air
and cause injury or damage to the ground and even
endanger the helicopter. Open doors (vehicles) or
gates (buildings) can be moved abruptly and with
great force.
For this reason, special instructions regarding PPE
apply in the immediate vicinity of helicopters, cf.
SCHMID, 2020.
Shortly before the drop, the drop-off area must always
be cleared of people.
Particularly in forest areas, branch breakage and the
resulting flying wood splinters caused by dropped
water should always be concerned.
With a straight approach, an area of 20 to 30 m on
both sides of the flight axis is sufficient. In detail, the
safety distance depends on
• Airspeed (here especially helicopter - aircraft) • if necessary, a curved flight, e.g. to reach the drop
zone on a slope.
• type of container/bucket and release-opening
• surroundings (trees/branches that may break due
to the drop off).
Emergency vehicles can provide a safe place of
retreat, but can be severely damaged by water drop-
offs from aircraft. In case of drop-offs by means of
external extinguishing containers (ALB) used by
helicopters, the risk is rather low, but especially for
aircraft belonging to the large categories with water
quantities of well over 2,000 liters this could be an
issue. In any case, attention must be paid to falling
branches or other breakage in the forest.
In case of emergency, an emergency drop can be
made on or in the immediate vicinity of the
appliances/units to give them a last chance to retreat
from the danger zone.
Immediately after the drop or, if necessary, after
several drops (in chain, line or staggered) the fire-
fighting attack must be continued on the ground!
In this context, the ground leader in the drop zone,
who is the tactical drop coordinator, plays an
important role, as he requests and coordinates further
approaches and gives ground units the go-ahead to
enter and leave the drop zone.
The tactical drop coordinator (drop observer and
coordinator) must have a secure and at all times
working radio link to the EAL Air [sector command
“air”].
2.4 Command and control of the "air" sector
of operations
Tactical command and control for air operations
means:
• Timely request (based on a fire development
forecast, for example the simple tactical forest fire
forecast according to CAMPBELL, 2005) of the appropriate aircraft (cf. classification of
aircraft into classes).
• Use of aircraft in the appropriate way (strategy
and tactics).
• Sufficient number of aircraft in the air (turnaround
times, including consideration of water fills on the
ground, refueling stops, crew exchange, etc.).
• Planning of water intake, addition of wetting
agents and later if necessary flame retardants -
optimization of flight routes and water intake
points in order to achieve a rapid turnaround.
There must be an immediate interruption of private
aircraft traffic during the operation (including drones,
hang-gliders, parachutists or similar) at the incident
site including all areas for landing, approach and
departure. This is most easily done by requesting and
imposing a flight restriction area (ED-R).
2.5 Command and Control in the air
For different types of aircraft, most countries
internationally use a commanding aircraft, usually
above the dropping aircraft. In Portugal and Spain,
this is mandatory whenever the number of aircraft
equals three or more. France also uses this
mechanism in special areas with the same types of
aircraft, for example, in case of fires at national
borders or in the vicinity of cities.
Until clear training requirements for all aircraft
operators and pilots have been established the
following rules apply to all aircraft operations by the
fire service:
• No helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft should be
used at the same time in the same section of the
operation/at the same location for the same
operation or at the same altitude!
• Several aircraft of the same type may be deployed
in one operational area if
* the operation is coordinated and * runs in one-way traffic (Fig. 2.7.1/1).
For this purpose and among other things, the
following must be clearly clarified via the aircraft
deployment section:
• Use of airspace (distances, flight levels)
• Approach and departure areas
• Waiting areas before dropping ("holdings")
• Addressing the aircraft
2.6 Video-, Bild- und WBK-Daten
Die Verfügbarkeit von diesen Daten ist für die
Führung am Boden (den Einsatz- bzw. auch den
Abschnittsleiter) sehr wichtig, um die richtigen
Entscheidungen treffen zu können.
Bilddaten (die viele Polizeihubschrauber erzeugen
können) sollten schnell und einfach zur Verfügung
gestellt werden können.
Besondere Absprachen sind mit dem Einsatz von
Drohnen (oder Unbemannte Luftfahrzeug-Systeme =
ULS bzw. Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles = UAV bzw.
Unmanned Air-craft System = UAS) – auch der
Feuerwehr – verbunden, wenn andere Luftfahr-zeuge
in dem Bereich sind.
Drohnen sind derzeit im direkten, zeitgleichen
Einsatzbereich bei Flugbetrieb anderer Luftfahrzeuge
auch für die Feuerwehr (oder andere) nicht zulässig!
Drohnen können durch den EAL Luft
eingesetzt werden, um zum Beispiel einen
Löscheinsatz zu kontrollieren oder Luftbilder
zu fertigen, wenn die Luftfahrzeuge zum
Beispiel einen Tankstopp einlegen müssen.
2.6 Video-
, Image- and TIC Data
The availability of such data is very important for
incident command (and sector commanders) in order
to make the right decisions.
Image data (which can be generated by many police
helicopters) should be made available fast and easily.
Special arrangements have to be made regarding the
use of drones (or Unmanned Aircraft = ULS or
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles = UAV or Unmanned
Aircraft System = UAS) - including those of the fire
service - while other aircraft are present in the area.
Drones are currently not permitted in direct,
simultaneous operation while other aircraft are
working in the same area. This applies also for the fire
service (or other organizations)!
Drones can be used by the EAL Luft (Sector
command “Air”), for example, to control a fire-
fighting operation or to take aerial photographs
whenever aircraft have to make a refueling stop,
for example. 2.7 Fire-fighting operations
Aircraft may be used in fire-fighting operations as
follows:
a) Direct extinguishing (with or without wetting agents
or gel formers).
b) Indirect firefighting (with retardant, currently not
available in Germany through BOS, but available from
the EU via the fixed civil protection mechanism or
rescEU mechanism, or gel formers)
c) Water transport (only with helicopters!) to a
container in for example hard-to-reach areas and from
there pick up with small pumps and conventional
firefighting via size D and size C hoses [diameter 25
mm or 42 mm).
The instructions for safe firefighting in section 2.3.2
apply!
2.7.1 Direct firefighting operations
Discharge follows the spread of the fire, i.e. basically
with the wind. Firefighting operations against the wind
are only possible when smoke and thermal conditions
permit to do so. This must always be investigated first
and special attention must be paid to one-directional-
traffic.
In addition to the general development of the situation,
the weather situation and forecast must also be taken
into account.
In the mountains or at steep slopes, approaches are
made flying up or across the slope. A direct attack on
a fire front is often not possible because of smoke and
thermal situations, and is generally ineffective if the
firefighters on the ground cannot immediately follow
up that fire on the ground.
Therefore, the "AFFE" tactic is usually used:
1. A nchor: Water drop-off starts at an anchor point
(natural or tactical break line), moves to the
2. f lanks with overlapping drops on the flanks to the
3. front and ends with
4. bordering or tying up the front. Normally, firefighting will thus be able to take place in
a chain-like line of drops. However, if wider fire
fronts/lines occur, it may be necessary to set
overlapping drops next to each other.
This applies regardless of whether one or more
aircraft is being used.
The minimum distance for dropping in a row with
several aircraft depends on the types of aircraft used
and the air speeds flown!
The EAL Air (Sector commander “Air”) determines the
minimum distance in consultation with the pilots
during a safety briefing.
The extinguishing effect is usually suffocating and
cooling. It has only a short-term suppressing effect
due to the formation of glowing embers and relatively
small amounts of water dropped on relatively large
areas and fire loads. It is - whenever possible necessary that firefighting units follow up immediately.
Only in absolute exceptional situations, the aircraft
can be the only means of firefighting possible for a
longer period of time (for example, in areas that are
difficult to reach, such as in moors or on steep slopes).
Here, too, an effective attack on the ground has to be
established as fast as possible, even if this is
elaborately!
Coordination between water dropping and units
attacking on the ground can only be achieved if a
tactical drop coordinator is available as a link between
the ground forces and the EAL Air (sector commander
“Air”).
In Germany, water drop-offs are currently always
carried out in form of a direct attack.
For indirect (for example, dropping of retardants as
breaking lines) or combined tactics (holding lines,
tactical use of fire in combination with firefighting
operations), Germany currently lacks the
corresponding tactical and technical prerequisites.
A preventive discharge of extinguishing water (even
with wetting agents) on "green" areas for watering or
wetting the area or the vegetation with aircraft is
uneconomical and should be avoided.
2.7.2 Drop-off modes
Helicopters offer more variation in dropping at their
own speed than other aircraft.
Influencing factors are
• Aircraft
*
-type
*
-speed
*
-height above ground
• Wind
*
-speed *
-strength
• Training level of the pilot
• Helicopter bucket type (ALB, equipment set) and,
if applicable, options to vary the container
openings (for example Semat).
• By varying the length of the bucket (ALB) load-
carrying device, the drop height can be changed
despite a constant flight altitude.
2.7.2.1 Influence of flight level
and drop-off height
The flight altitude (distance of the aircraft to the
ground) determines the effects of the down- or
sidewash on responding units, the vegetation (break-
off of branches) and the fire.
The drop-off height (distance from the lower edge of
the helicopter bucket (ALB) to the ground) determines
the decomposition of the water jet and thus the
extinguishing effect on the ground.
A low discharge height provides for a more compact
jet and is therefore suitable for dense vegetation.
However, care must be taken to ensure that this also
may lead to fanning the fire and, probably, a bigger
threat to responding personnel and equipment on the
ground.
A higher discharge level ensures a finer distribution of
the extinguishing water and is suitable for bushes or
grassland. A drop height that is too high (e.g. 500 m,
choosen maybe because of ammunition suspected) is
ineffective, especially in mid-summer, because the
fine distribution and evaporation of the water will not
achieve a significant extinguishing effect.
2.7.2.2 Drop-off technique
When dropping-off water, the aircraft should drop
approximately ⅓ into the "black" and ⅔ into the
"green" so as not to accelerate the spread of fire. In
addition, a miss into the green wets the vegetation and thus still
has a (short-term) fire-retardant effect, whereas a
miss throw into the black shows no spread-inhibiting
effect.
Follow-up drop-offs must be made in an overlapping
manner, otherwise the fire will develop through
advance through the gap created.
Suppression is always started from the air at an
anchor point, usually at the base (heal/back) of the fire
(see fig. 2.7.1/1).
Only in case of small fires with ground units the head
of the fire can be attacked directly.
Drops on fully developed fires (trees in full blaze,
flame height greater than 20 m) with slow-flying
helicopters are usually too dangerous to be performed
from effective heights and are often ineffective due to
the intensity of the fire.
Drop-off onto suspected ammunition areas are
usually ineffective due to the required safety distances
= flying altitude (usually greater than 500 m). The
exact determination of the necessary distances (=
dropping heights) is carried out by the responsible
explosive ordnance expert and must always be
adhered to!
2.7.2.3 Use of ALB with different
load suspension devices
Depending on the aircraft and their operating
agencies, there are very different specifications, how
to fly with external loads. The type of load handling
attachment (LAM = "lines") used between the primary
load hook of the helicopter and the external load (short
or long) differs from operator to operator. In particular
the special features of the individual procedures must
be coordinated, since different lengths of the LAMs
also allow for different maximum speeds and, as a
rule, the pick-up from certain water intake points (e.g.
flextanks) is not possible or only possible to a limited
extent. Tank installed/attached to the helicopter ("belly tank"):
Some types of helicopters used for fire-fighting
nowadays have a fire-fighting water tank directly built
in under the fuselage (between the skids /
undercarriage). The water is taken in either by a built-
in pump with a suction hose or by filling the tank at an
external landing site by the fire service.
At present, no such helicopter is available in
Germany. However, those models are already in
operation in Europe, for example in Italy. In principle,
it would be possible to deploy them across the EU
borders.
This type of water drop-off generates a lot of
downwash in the drop zone, especially at slower
airspeeds, since flight altitude and drop height are
identical. If the approach is too low, the downwash can
fan the fire. On the other hand, flight safety is
increased, as there are no long LAMs hanging below
the helicopter.
Container hooked directly onto the helicopter ("belly
hook"):
The ALB (bucket) is hooked directly onto the
helicopter and is therefore situated only a few meters
below the helicopter. Depending on the length of the
hanger attached to the bucket this varies by a few
meters. The pilot can only watch the bucket via his
mirrors, an external load camera or as told by a crew
member or flight assistant.
It is almost impossible for the bucket to swing
backwards into the range of the tail rotor, which is
possible in principle when longer LAMs are used while
emptying quickly and performing an accelerated take-
off. During flight less pendulum movements occur.
Therefore this is also an advantage when filling water
tanks by helicopter.
If the helicopter is heavily tilted, there is a risk that the
tail boom will touch the water surface or the ground
when picking up water with the bucket submerged,
which can lead to severe damage of the aircraft!
This type of water dropping generates a lot of
downwash in the drop zone, especially at slower
airspeeds, since flight altitude and drop height are
almost equal. If the approach is too low, the heavy
downwash can therefore fan the fire. On the other hand, this procedure increases flight
safety, as there are no long LAMs hanging below the
helicopter. 12 to 20 feet tag line ("short line").
This corresponds to a LAM with a length of about 4 m
to 7 m and is mainly used as a substitute for belly
hooks, especially for taking in saltwater, in order to
reduce saltwater contamination.
It should be noted here that the external load is then
not within the range of 1.5 times the rotor diameter
and thus outside the maximum downwash.
50 foot line ("longline"):
This corresponds to a LAM with a length of about
18 m. The advantage of this variant is that the bucket
hangs lower under the helicopter, thus there is less
danger of the tail boom being damaged when picking
up water with the bucket submerged.
Also, this results in less downwash on the ground but
more pendulum movement.
For water intake points such as small pools, AB with
an Open Container [pod systems operated by the fire
service] or flex tanks, the water intake is more difficult
or not possible due to the higher pendulum effect. Of
course, this also applies to water delivery into tanks,
cf. figure 2.7.2.3/3. This problem increases with
increasing rope length.
Therefore, fire service air support units should always
be available on the ground to brief the pilot via radio. Equal to or greater than 100 feet line
This is equivalent to a LAM greater than 40 meters in
length. Normally the ALB (bucket) is no longer visible
to the pilot via the mirrors, so either a "bubble-window"
(specially curved side window), a special external
camera or an observer in the helicopter is needed. For
this purpose, someone on the ground should
communicate the height above ground level, to avoid
touching the ground with the ALB. The longer the
LAM, the greater the pendulum movements in flight.
2.7.2.4 Recommendations for drop modes
The following approximate values8 apply in principle:
1. Statements regarding the flight altitude (in
combination with speed) are independent of the
bucket type, as they primarily minimize the effects of
the downwash on the ground.
2. Statements concerning the dropping height (in
combination with the speed) depend on the type of
bucket, since the initial water jet as well as its
decomposition depend very much on the type of
bucket as well as on the selected opening (e.g. Semat
full jet, spray jet and central discharge). Grass and reed fires Lower extinguishing intensity because of low fire load,
but high rate of fire spread, therefore wider and longer
discharge (high velocity (approx. 50 to 70 kt = 90 to
130 km/h), normal dropping height (about 75 to 100 ft
= 23 to 30 m) with less water per sqm (about 0.6 to 1
l/m²).
Bush and heath fires
Higher extinguishing intensity required, therefore
lower airspeed, therefore smaller impact area with
more water per m² (about 1.5 to 1.8 l/m²) less speed (about 30 to 40 kt = 55 to 75 km/h, lowest safe
dropping height or flying altitude).
Spot fire
(e.g. a single tree after a lightning strike in impassable
terrain, or a new fire site as a spot fire in front of the
fire front due to flying sparks), therefore drop at low
speed with higher altitude. A speed of ≥ 15kt /
~30km/h and an altitude of three times the rotor
diameter (3xD) is recommended. This results in
almost no impact of the rotor downwash to the ground,
which reduces the risk of fire being fanned or even
driven forward.
Point drops (spot drops) from a hover or low and slow
approaches should always be avoided. They lead to
the fire being fanned and sparks / burning material
being stirred up, which can have considerable
consequences.
Point drops (spot drops) over larger fires can be
dangerous due to the thermals, the pollutants9 and
soot, and possibly also less oxygen. This can lead to
severe (consequential) damage or even to the failure
of aircraft engines!
Only on steep slopes with individual islands of burning
vegetation point drops (spot drops) may be an
appropriate means of choice. As a rule, because of
the location on the slope, a curved drop (aircraft
approaches, turns steeply before the slope and the
ALB (bucket) on the line swings towards the slope,
triggering the drop) may be the better choice. This,
however, requires a pilot who is used to flying in the
mountains with external water buckets (and therefore
changing loads during the flight!) and who is familiar
with the region from an aeronautical point of view. Filling tanks/containers
For the purpose of transporting water to remote areas,
the helicopter can be used to fill containers. This is
done while hovering above the tank. A guide as well
as a watchout on the ground are mandatory.
Buckets as well as the ground containers used must
be suitable and compatible for this operation, for
example, the ground container must be sufficiently
stable and secured to the ground.
2.7.3 Extinguishing agents
Water from open sources is most commonly used. A
wetting agent (Class A foam) can only be added if the
tank on the aircraft is equipped with a separate
proportioning unit. This is available, for example, for
the Bambi bucket types, but is not (yet) used in
Germany.
If water is taken in at external landing sites by means
of hose filling, tank exchange procedures or from
special containers, this can also be done by adding
0.1 to 0.3 per cent wetting agent (Class A foam). This
is particularly useful if the fire has already penetrated
into the upper layers of the soil, or if the fire involves
densely lying deadwood (e.g. logging residues).
Here, too, it must be borne in mind that responding
units have to work in the danger zone of the
helicopter. Therefore, appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE), communication equipment and
training is necessary.
The water intake must always be set up as close as
possible to the assigned drop point. If the appropriate
material and, if necessary, personnel (for filling hoses
and changing containers) are available, a water intake
by these methods is preferable to the option of taking
water from open water resources, provided this
reduces the flight time by at least one to two minutes
per cycle When using natural open water resources, but even
more when using artificial lakes (for example, former
or active gravel pits), special requirements are placed
on the water intake points. In principle, the following
resources are suitable for open water pick-up:
• Lakes and reservoirs (provided they are not
drinking water reservoirs; the use of these should
always be agreed in advance with the relevant
authorities or operators).
• larger canals (provided they have been closed to
navigation)
• larger and deep rivers with moderate flow
velocities (e.g. rivers like Elbe, Weser)
• outdoor swimming pools (provided they have
been opened and cleared)
• Artificially constructed rainwater catchment
basins or the like
It is also possible to take water from special containers
set up by the fire service. This is particularly useful for
economical aerial- and fire-fighting operations where
there are no other suitable open water resources in
the vicinity for direct water pick-up, but where there
are, for example, cisterns or water tapping points
along streams, from which this tank can be
continuously refilled by the fire service.
The following should be noted:
• Containers with flexible walls (all "self-erecting"
ones) and those with walls with supports are
highly sensitive to
* contact with sharp stones (substrate must be
cleaned beforehand, or covered or
straightened!)
* contact with the LAM or ALB.
• Containers with solid walls (e.g. correspondingly
large containers, high and open at the top) must
not have any protrusions or corners, where the
LAM or ALB can get caught or be damaged.
A briefing of the pilot on approach for these small
water intake points is usually necessary! The final decision on the suitability or non-suitability of
a (proposed/planned) extinguishing water intake point
is made exclusively by the helicopter crew.
These selection criteria for open water extraction
points are structured as follows:
• distance to the incident site
• size and depth of the water body
• vegetation of the water body
• hazards and obstacles in the water (objects in and
under water, steel cables, water sports and play
facilities, groynes and jetties, but also watercraft
and swimmers, etc.)
• hazards and obstacles around and above the
water body (buildings, power lines, wind turbines,
bathing areas, traffic routes, etc.),
• emergency landing areas in the immediate vicinity
of water bodies
• clearances required for water intake?
• access routes to the water body and to
emergency landing areas
Water intake points and the surrounding area must be
cordoned off to prevent unauthorised persons.
Furthermore, rescue equipment (boat) should be kept
available, as water intake and dropping are the most
dangerous flight conditions. Most "forest fire countries" (Southern Europe, USA,
Australia etc.) use with great success (with a few
exceptions in extremely protected areas of nature)
retardants as a further tool to fight fires and prevent
their further spread. In case of very large fires, this
agent can, if necessary be requested using the EU's
civil protection mechanism or rescEU. Currently the
use of gel formers is being tested in the USA, among
other countries, as they are environmentally friendly
and not harmful to water, they are cheaper and are
more versatile.
2.7.4 Training of pilots and aircraft crews
Pilots and aircrews should be trained and instructed
in the tactics and techniques for their respective
missions. Also basics of wildland fires and simplified
tactical forest fire forecasting should be trained.
Where appropriate tactical firefighting training is not
available to aircraft crews, appropriately trained
personnel (e.g. aerial observers, Fire Service Air
Support units) must be deployed by the fire service to
provide specialist advice - if necessary, they must be
deployed on board the aircraft. Cooperation with the
fire service during operations - taking into account and
depending on the availability of aircraft capacity,
should be practiced regularly.
Similar to other countries (for example Australia10 ), it
is recommended to establish minimum common
arrangements to ensure safe and efficient operations.
A uniform Europe-wide or Germany-wide legal
regulation on the requirements to be met by aircraft
crews in wildland firefighting does not currently exist. 2.8 Aircraft selection
Depending on the intended use and availability, the
right aircraft must be selected, as far as there is a
choice, especially in case of longer and larger
situations.
These aircraft can be entered in advance into
corresponding tables for your own areas of operation.
Means to mobilize those units can also be entered in
advance in these tables.
Especially in case of larger or more complex
situations, it is advisable to establish a suitable
specialist adviser for aircraft operations who has the
necessary expertise to be able to advise the head of
operations or S 3 [sector commander “operations”] in
a staff in the selection and later to advise the sector
commander “Air” or “Aircraft operations” (in Bavaria:
Fliegerische Einsatzleitung, FliegE).
The development in Germany is always progressing,
so that the selection of aircraft with different
capabilities in the individual federal states will be
easier in the future due to local conditions (increasing
equipment of police helicopters with ALB buckets) or
existing multi-level concepts. Therefore, the selection
could be simplified or specified.
2.9 Request (clearance, routes, costs)
The request for aircraft is regulated completely
differently in the federal states [of Germany] and must
be taken into account in each case, because even an
incorrect request route or uncoordinated access to
third parties can have a considerable impact on the
costs and or their sponsorship as well as the request
times!
A timely request, taking into account the expected
spread of the fire, ensures the success of the
operation. Note: Unless otherwise regulated, authorities may
only charge each other for the additional costs
incurred as a result of official assistance11
.
2.10 Sector Commander “Air”
As soon as a planned and regular flight operation is
intended or carried out at an incident site, according
to FwDV 100 [German Fire Service Regulation 100 –
Incident Command], an air sector commander (Sector
Command “Air”) should be appointed.
The tasks and responsibilities of the EAL Air concern
in particular:
• Determination of the operational level and/or
forward planning with regard to the further
development.
• Structuring of the airspace and determination of
approach and holding areas, also taking into
account the characteristics of the aircraft.
• Allocation of orders to the aircraft.
• (Further) advising the incident commander or, in
case of very large missions, if necessary, also a
(task) sector commander or an FEL or TEL
[command posts].
* in the selection and
* for the deployment of aircraft.
• in particular for the areas of operation:
* transport of extinguishing-water
* extinguishing water drop-off
* personnel transport
* transport of material (to remote areas that are
difficult or impossible to be accessed by
vehicles),
* rescue from dangerous situations.
• Establishment and operation of the air operations
sector, as a rule, also with personnel with an
aviation background (e.g. from the circle of pilots,
air traffic controllers, operators) for aeronautical
radio operations, if no own forces and resources
are available for this purpose.  Ensuring the means and channels of
communication for the mission.
• Cooperation with the aircraft pilots or operators for
flight operations.
• Prepare and set up of an outdoor landing zone as
a helipad:
* Selection in consultation with pilots
* Keeping the helipad free of third parties
* Setting up the operation at the helipad
* If necessary, set-up and fire protection of a
remote refueling station.
• Research into suitable (emergency) landing sites,
if possible at airports, for technical defects or
maintenance tasks.
The support of the EAL Air (sector commander “Air”)
by additional personnel in the operational sector
command may become necessary. It has been shown
that establishing both a command assistant (FüAss)
for cooperation with aircraft (FüAss “Air”) and for
ground support units (FüAss “Ground”) makes sense.
In this context, it is necessary that the FüAss “Air” has
the appropriate training for the coordination of aircraft
(e.g. air traffic controller, flight (mission) leader, pilot).
If this is not available from the ranks of the fire service,
appropriate personnel from aircraft operators shall be
deployed for this purpose. At least in case of larger, longer or more complex
operations involving aircraft a tactical airdrop
coordinator is to be appointed on site in the respective
ground sector as a link between sector command “air”
and ground units.
This coordinator ensures the safety of ground units by
clearing the drop zone (about 25 to 30 m to the side
of the drop line is sufficient!) in good time, but also for
the early resumption of firefighting activities after the
drops and feedback on the effectiveness of the
extinguishment, if necessary for an adjustment of
water drop-offs. The following organizational chart
shows an example of a mission with the participation
of aircraft at operative level 2 or 3. 2.11 Flight operations
For flight operations, the following must be explored,
represented or ensured:
• Weather
* Representation of the regional weather
situation and development
* In particular, wind direction and strength at/on
the
- external helipad
- drop-off area
- auxiliary airfields (e.g. glider airfields)
• Communication plan
* Air - air (between different aircraft and to the
locally responsible air traffic control center)
* Ground - ground (between the different parties
involved in the EA Air, for example EAL Air,
landing site, drop zones ... )
* Air - ground (between deployed aircraft and
ground forces, especially if there are various
direct communication requirements, e.g. during
the pick-up of external loads as well as when dropping or
setting down loads in the area of operation.
* It is advisable to clearly mark the aircraft
(especially the helicopters) to make them more
easily recognized and addressed. This is all the
more important the more the same or similar
helicopters are used at an incident site.
Recommended is to mark them with single-digit
Arabic numerals. This must be done in
consultation with the pilots or aircraft operators.
* An additional allocation based on the ALB is
also useful, if this is possible. In Bavaria, for
example, 9/11 is the 11th container with a
capacity of 900 liters. 50/01 would be the first
5000 liters container in Bavaria. This gives the
drop coordinator a good possibility to reconcile
aircraft and ALB (bucket) in the event of a drop.
• Operational plan
* Which aircraft are needed when, how and for
what purpose?
* Medium- and long-term planning, especially
taking into account the operational objectives of
the incident commander.
* Downtime pre-planning for in particular planned
operations such as:
- Possible flight times (daylight, fog,
weather, etc.).
- Necessary break times (for example, no
more than 2 h flight time per crew member,
followed by a 40 min break, cf. statutory
regulation Spain). These details are to be
discussed during the briefing before the
mission with the respective pilots.
- Necessary maintenance times of the
technical equipment
• Request and deployment of support units with
personnel and material, for example
* setup and protection of an external helipad and
in its vicinity, if necessary
* setup and operation of a load pick-up and load
drop-off area. * There, if necessary, in addition for a field
refueling station to refuel helicopters. Note:
This is only possible in cooperation with aircraft
operators, as only they have suitable refueling
vehicles available.
* Transport of water for firefighting with external
water tenders
- into the drop zone (if necessary, direct
communication with the aircraft is
mandatory).
- from a sufficiently large and stable folding
container secured against the downwash
(watertight roll-off container [pod system],
e.g. AB Mulde [open container] with at
least 2 m high side walls). The water
height should be 1.5 times the height of the
ALB (bucket).
- In a sufficiently large and stable folding
container secured against downwash in
the area of operation, in order to be able to
work with small portable fire pumps (TS)
and D-hoses (25 mm diameter) in the area
with ground units.
• Briefing of responding units deployed in the
vicinity of the aircraft.
• Securing of the landing sites and water intake
points with appropriately equipped personnel and
material, also for off-road rescue, including water
rescue units.
3. Categorization of aircraft
3.1 Levels of operation in connection
with aircraft
Aircraft are deployed in several stages, depending on
the complexity of the situation as well as the number
and variants of aircraft in operation.
As a rule, only aircraft with BOS radio (police, possibly
already federal police) will be deployed in level 1. From level 2 onwards, aircraft of the Federal Police
are used and it must be expected that aircraft, e.g.
from the German Armed Forces or from private
companies do not have BOS radio equipment
available.
From level 3 onwards, this will be the rule.
Level 4 will only be used in Germany if, in parallel to
helicopters fixed-wing aircraft (e.g. via rescEU
mechanism) are to be used for fire-fighting. This will
have considerable consequences for flight operations
(in terms of space and time) and must be carefully
planned!
Operations at night and in poor visibility
For safety reasons, operations at night and in poor
visibility can only take place very rarely. They can only
be implemented if the aircraft carry appropriate
equipment for night flights, the pilots are appropriately
trained, the area of operation permits this and the
situation makes it absolutely necessary
(concrete danger to life, limb or significant material
assets). In the "load work" stage, not only predefined external
loads, e.g. buckets (external load containers), but
loads to be set up individually will be handled. In
particular, regulation DGUV 214-911 applies. In these
cases it is important to ensure basic and advanced
training and equipment for the personnel involved
This load-level can be used in parallel with the other
levels.
3.2 Categorization of aircraft
In order to be able to plan and communicate more
easily and clearly during incidents, aircraft must be
clearly identifiable in terms of their mission value.
For this purpose, they have been categorized
internationally for a long time.
The categorization should be done at the latest at the
helipad (usually an external landing site).
Close cooperation with aircraft crews via suitable
communication channels is always necessary! 3.2.1 Unmanned aerial systems ("drones")
Reference is made here to the extensive joint
recommendations of operational organisations on the
use of drones (BBK, 2020)!
UAS (unmanned aircraft system) and UAV
(unmanned aircraft vehicle) are extensively used
today by
• private users, use by emergency services is
enabled via relevant legal standards covering the
use of other people’s property during incidents.
• BOS organisations.
UAS are available as
• Rotorcraft (working in one place is possible)
• fixed-wing aircraft (usually only used by
commercial users and the German Armed Forces
When using UAS, attention must be paid, among
other things, to
• radio range or shadowing for the remote control
and the usually independent image data
transmission.
• Interference from electromagnetic fields
As soon as manned aircraft are deployed in an
area of operation, their use (including "BOS
drones") in the area is to be prohibited!
The private use of drones in this area is prohibited
in accordance with current Drone Regulations.
This must be communicated via the media and
social media and if necessary, monitored on site! 3.2.2 Helicopters
Helicopters can be used for
• early forest fire detection / surveillance /
observation flights
• reconnaissance, aerial photography and image
transmission from air to ground
• guidance of several aircraft in the area of
operation. This always takes place at a flight level
well above the other aircraft deployed. They are
manned by a pilot and appropriately trained
personnel to guide the other aircraft. Radio traffic
shall normally be conducted using aeronautical
radios.
• Extinguishing with buckets (external load
containers)
* Direct fire-fighting
* Indirect extinguishing or water transport into a
container
• Transport of material
• Transport of equipment (in the aircraft or as
external load)
Classification of helicopters for fire-fighting
operations into classes or types Assignment of helicopters for rescue
missions:
For pre-planned helicopter operations covering
rescue missions in heavy terrain or dynamic situations
(e.g. heavy rain, floods, rapidly developing fires)
generally only high-performance rescue helicopters
with winches are suitable
Helicopters without winches can only be used if
landing in the affected area is possible. As a rule, this
is not or no longer possible in such situations.
A rescue procedure using a rope may be useful, as
several people can be rescued at the same time. The
rope rescue method is usually faster than a winch
method.
Therefore, the following helicopters can be pre-
planned for the rescue:
• equipped with a winch
• with hook systems for transporting persons on the
recovery rope using two load hooks
• without winch with appropriate equipment for
passenger pick-up as an internal load
3.2.3 Fixed-wing aircraft
Fixed-wing aircraft can be used for
• early forest fire detection/monitoring/observation
flights
• Reconnaissance from the air • Commanding several aircraft in the area of
operation. This is always done on a flight level
well above the other deployed aircraft. They are
then manned by a pilot and with appropriately
trained personnel to guide the other aircraft.
Radio traffic is normally to be conducted on
aeronautical radio frequencies.
• Firefighting aircraft (only those which would also
be available in the EU) are to be requested via
reporting and alerting channels applicable in the
respective federal states for example for the
rescEU mechanism): 4 Outlook and
further developments
In accordance with the experience of nations in the
frequent use of aircraft for firefighting, efforts should
be made to ensure that experience is gained through
a "lessons-learned14 process" and a regular exchange
in training and further educational events.
The more these tactical options become established
in Germany and internationally, the better the
international exchange must become. Emerging developments, for example, for early
standardization procedures for the deployment of
aircraft from the USA (organizing a "FTA" = Fire
Traffic Area) covering rules for the approach of
aircraft, for their communication and control in the
operation of the same; cf. NWCG, 2020) are
interesting and to be established as soon as this is
possible through uniform tactics and training for this
purpose.


Introduction
This Fire Facts report sets out the key information on
the fires we attend where there are fatal casualties.
We have a continuous record of the number of all fires
and fire deaths since 1966 after the creation of the
Greater London area. More detailed records on the
numbers of fire deaths start in 2000 when electronic
recording systems were introduced by LFB.
A brief history of the London Fire Brigade
The roots of a single fire service responsible for
London start in 1833 when, under the leadership of
James Braidwood, the LONDON FIRE ENGINE
ESTABLISHMENT was formed. The London Fire Engine
Establishment was a private enterprise, funded by the
insurance companies and as such was responsible
mainly for saving material goods from fire.
In June 1861, a huge conflagration at Cotton’s Wharf,
a riverside warehouse in Tooley Street, Southwark,
claimed the life of James Braidwood, and resulted in
insurance claims for more than £2 million (£1.6bn at
today’s value). The subsequent increase in insurance
premiums caused many of the merchants of the City
to protest to the Lord Mayor. A Select Committee of
the House of Commons was appointed ‘to enquire
into the existing state of legislation and of any existing
arrangements for the protection of life and property
against fire in the Metropolis’.
In 1865, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act was
passed, placing responsibility for the fire service in the
metropolis upon the Board of Works. The London Fire
Establishment continued to function until 1 January
1866, on which date the new METROPOLITAN FIRE
BRIGADE formally came into existence. Captain Sir Eyre
Massey Shaw, who had been appointed as the
Superintendent of the London Fire Establishment after
Braidwood’s death, remained in charge of the newly
formed brigade.
On 21 March 1889, by virtue of the Local Government
Act 1888, the Metropolis, including the City, was
converted into the Administrative County of London;
the Metropolitan Board of Works went out of
existence and its functions taken over by the London
County Council (LCC). In 1904, the London County
Council changed the name of the service from the
Metropolitan Fire Brigade to the LONDON FIRE BRIGADE.
In March 1938, ahead of the start of the Second
World War, recruitment started in London for an
Auxiliary Fire Service. Heavy air raids during the Blitz
(1940/1941) had shown that regional firefighting
resources were insufficient and the Government
decided to unify the services. On 18 August 1941 the
NATIONAL FIRE SERVICE (NFS) came into being.
The NFS continued to provide a service in peacetime
after the war until 1 April 1948 when the Fire Service
Act 1947 placed responsibility for fire brigades on
county and ‘county borough’ councils. At this time the
London Fire Brigade was once more under of the
London County Council.
The local government of London changed again in
1965 when the Greater London area was formally
defined and created by the London Government Act
1963, which came into force on 1 April 1965. This
new area replaced the former administrative counties
of Middlesex and London (the LCC), adding the City
of London and absorbing parts of Kent, Surrey, Essex,
a small part of Hertfordshire and the county boroughs
of Croydon, East Ham and West Ham. This new area
was governed by the newly formed GREATER LONDON
COUNCIL (GLC). The GLC took over running the
London Fire Brigade in 1965 which was expanded
with the fire stations, fire appliances and fire staff from
the areas absorbed into Greater London from
surrounding counties, including most of the former
county of Middlesex, and parts of Essex, Kent, Surrey,
and a small part of Hertfordshire.
In 1986 the Greater London Council was abolished
and the Local Government Act 1985 transferred the
functions of fire service and civil defence to a newly
formed LONDON FIRE AND CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY
(LFCDA) which took over on the 1 April 1986.
LFB | Fatal fires in Greater London 2022 v
On 7 May 1998 Londoners voted in a referendum
asking whether there was support for Greater London
Authority, made up of an elected mayor and a
separately elected assembly. Londoners voted 72 per
cent in favour and the new governance structure was
set out in the Greater London Authority Act 1999. On
the 3 July 2000 the LFCDA was reconstituted as the
LONDON FIRE AND EMERGENCY PLANNING AUTHORITY.
From 1 April 2018 under the Police and Crime Act
2017 LFEPA was abolished and the LONDON FIRE
COMMISSIONER (LFC) was established as a corporation
sole, reporting to the Mayor of London. The LFC is the
head of the London Fire Brigade and is the fire and
rescue service for the Greater London area.
The Mayor has appointed a Deputy Mayor for fire and
resilience. The London Assembly provides scrutiny of
the new arrangements via a Fire, Resilience and
Emergency Planning Committee.
The Brigade sets out how its prevention, protection
and response activities will best be used to mitigate
the impact of risk on communities in its Integrated
Risk Management Plan (IRMP). The most recent plan,
known as ‘Your London Fire Brigade’ was approved in
January 2023. The Brigade also publishes a Local
Assessment of Risk in London which is available on
the LFB website –here to look at how we understand
risk in different areas of London.
Scope of this document
In this report we focus on those incidents that happen
within the boundaries of Greater London since 1966.
Recording fire incidents and casualties
In 1966, fires were recorded using Fire Report forms
K433 and K433H. Fire Report form K433 was
introduced by the Home Office and Scottish Home
Department in 1953 for recording every fire with the
exception of chimney fires confined to (did not spread
beyond) chimneys. Casualty information was
recorded in Part 5.
The Fire Damage Report (FDR1) was introduced in
January 1978 as a new recording method. The FDR1
LFB | Fatal fires in Greater London 2022 Introduction
was revised in 1994. The FDR1 form included details
of fire casualties, including fatal casualties.
Fire recording changed again in 2008 when the
government introduced a national Incident Recording
System (IRS) which was the first fully electronic fire
recording system (prior to which records were
submitted to government on paper and the national
statistics from these based on sampling). Again, the
IRS records full details of fire casualties.
LFB electronic data collection
LFB started collecting incident data electronically in
April 1999 via its Incident Recording Information
System (IRIS). This included fire incidents although
not FDR1 data, like the details of casualties. FDR1 data
was captured electronically from 1 January 2005. LFB
began supplying data to the new national IRS on 3
November 2008 via its Incident Management System
(IMS), which replaced the IRIS. More comprehensive
and consistent recording of fire deaths happened
from this date, so 2009 is the first full calendar year for
which we have consistently recorded data.
Categories of fire
A reportable fire is ‘an event of uncontrolled burning
involving flames, heat or smoke which was attended
by a fire and rescue authority, or which was a late fire
call’.
The categories for fire have remained unchanged
since the introduction of the FDR1. Fires are
categorised as either Primary, Secondary, Chimney or
Late Call.
Primary fires are more serious fires that harm people
or cause damage to property. More information is
collected about primary fires than other types of fire.
In the changes to the FDR1 in 1994 the definition for
primary fires was broadened to include a small
number of fires where there was no fire damage but
there was damage from heat and smoke.
Primary fires have one or more of the following
characteristics:
(a) all fires in buildings and vehicles that are not
derelict or in outdoor structures,
vi
(b) (c) any fires involving casualties or rescues,
any fire attended by five or more appliances.
A late call is when a fire and rescue service is called
to a fire when it is known, prior to the call, that the fire
has already been extinguished. In this report, late calls
are included in the totals for primary fires. There are
typically less than 20 late calls per year. As a result of a
late call, a casualty can be discovered. In such cases,
the fire will be recorded as a primary fire.
Secondary fires are less serious fires and less
information is recorded about these fires. If there is a
casualty at a fire that would otherwise be determined
to be a secondary fire (e.g. as a result of an outdoor
fires including grassland and rubbish fires, or in a
derelict building), the fire will be recorded as a
Primary Fire in accordance with the recording protocol
outlined above.
Where fire crews record the motive for a fire they are
categorised as follows:
(a) (b) Accidental fires, including those where the cause
was not known or unspecified.
Deliberate fires, including those where deliberate
ignition is merely suspected.
Deaths in fires and fire as the cause of death
(role of the Coroner)
Fire fatalities include any fatal casualty which is the
direct or indirect result of injuries caused by a fire
incident. Even if the fatal casualty dies subsequently,
any fatality whose cause is attributed to a fire is
included in the Brigade’s and government published
statistics.
There are also occasional cases where a Coroner may
rule that the fire was not the cause of death. As a
Coroner’s inquest will not have been held for all fire
fatalities in the latest year reported here, the number
of fatalities is subject to revision.
A person who dies as a result of a fire is a relatively
rare event. Often, it is simple to determine that fire
(and the effects of fire, like smoke) was the cause of
death; our specialist fire investigators will make an
initial judgement for statistical recording purposes.
LFB | Fatal fires in Greater London 2022 Introduction
However, it will be for a Coroner to determine the
cause of death.
Following an inquest, and associated autopsy (or post-
mortem examination), it is sometimes determined that
a heart attack, stroke or another pre-existing medical
condition, was the cause of death and the fire
occurred subsequently.
The data for fire deaths included in this report will
reflect the view of the Coroner that fire was the cause
of death, except for some fire deaths in the most
recent year, where a Coroner’s inquest is outstanding.
For 2017, the Coroner’s inquest into the Grenfell
Tower fire deaths has opened and has been
adjourned until the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry has
concluded.
Fire investigation work
Where there are ‘persons reported’ or fatal or non-
fatal casualties at a fire, then the Brigade’s Fire
Investigation Team will attend the incident scene. As
necessary, they will work with the Police and other
agencies to investigate the fire. The Brigade’s
experienced fire investigators will determine the
cause of a fire and, where there is a fatality, how they
think a person has died. The data from these
investigations is captured as part of the LFB’s incident
recording process and will be the Brigade’s definitive
view of the fire.

Fire deaths by head of population
(Table 1.1)
The number of fire deaths in London have been falling
steadily since the early 1990s. Numbers increased in
2017 because of the multiple deaths from the Grenfell
Tower fire.

Legislative changes impacting on the
number of fire deaths
As well as work on fire prevention and an increase in
smoke alarm ownership, legislative change has also
contributed to the reduction in fire deaths. Most
notably the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety)
Regulations 1988 which improved the fire retardants
of home furniture and reduced the amount of fatally
toxic smoke when ignited.
The reduction in fires since 2001 is linked to the
introduction of the first Community Safety Strategy
which the former LFEPA approved in September
20001
. This strategy changed the focus of the London
Fire Brigade from being a mainly reactive emergency
response service to a proactive service with fire
prevention at the core of its activities.

NOTE: ONS Mid Year Estimates population statistics for 2022 were
currently unavailable at time of publishing. Data will be updated when
available. This data may include updates for the 2022 census.
Long term trends | Chapter 1
By 2016/17, an estimated 95 per cent of homes in
England had a smoke alarm fitted2
.
Fires with fatalities which are not fire-
related
A few of the fatalities at fires are not caused by the
fire. Sometimes, people die (from events such as heart
attacks or strokes) and the fire starts as a result of their
death; for example a person who had started cooking
at the time of their heart attack may go on to have a
cooking fire because it is unattended.
As outlined earlier, the Coroner will determine
whether fire, or the effects of the fire (like smoke) was
the cause of death.
Typically, since 2005, there have been about five fires
each year at which a fatality was discovered, where
later it was determined (by the Coroner) that fire was
not the cause of death.

Long term trends | Chapter 1
Multiple fire fatalities
(Table 1.2)
Fire deaths are rare and relatively randomly occurring
events. But sometimes circumstances can lead to
multiple fatalities at a single fire.
Multiple fatality fires are very rare - LFB records show
that there have been 27 fires between 1966 and 2022
(56 years) where four or more people died.
Table 1.2 details the 27 fires where four or more
people died. Data for these fires from 2000 onwards is
taken from LFB electronic records; data before this
may be less reliable and relies on published sources.
In 2021, there were two fires with four or more
fatalities, in which eight people (in total) died.
Any additional information that can be provided to
ensure completeness should be emailed to
data@london-fire.gov.uk.
Fires with fire related fatalities
(Tables 1.3 and 1.4)
It is useful for analysis purposes to make a distinction
between the number of fires in which one or more
people died (a ‘fire with fire related fatalities’), and the
numbers of actual fatalities arising from fires.
Some of the tables in this Fire Facts report are based
on the analysis of ‘fatal fires’ and some are based on
the numbers of fatal casualties. In all cases, the charts
and tables will make this clear.
Over the five years to 2022, 95 per cent of fires with
fatalities had a single casualty under three per cent
had two casualties, with less than two per cent having
three or more casualties and less than two per cent of
fires with four or more fatalities. Chapter 2 | When and where fire deaths happen
This chapter looks at the property types where fire
deaths occur, the reason for fire and the number of
fires in each London borough. This chapter looks at
the data since 2000 - where more detailed electronic
records are available.
Fire motive
(Table 2.1 and 2.2)
Firefighters record the suspected motive (reason) for
the start of a fire. Fires are categorised as: accidental,
deliberate or unknown, according to the probable
cause, as observed at the scene. For fires where there
is a fatal or non-fatal casualty, a specialist fire
investigator would attend and then confirm the fire
motive.
Deliberate fires are those where a fire is suspected to
have been started deliberately (but not always with a
malicious intent), for example some fires are started
by children. Deliberate fires, where someone dies,
may also include suicides.
The motive reflects the nature of the ‘uncontrolled
burning’. For example, whilst a bonfire will be started
deliberately, if it gets out of control and sets light to a
nearby shed, the motive will be recorded as
accidental; the uncontrolled shed fire was an
accidental consequence of the deliberate bonfire.
Arson is the criminal act associated with deliberate fire
setting. However, fires with a deliberate motive will
not always be arson; for example, a person may
choose to set fire to their own property in a controlled
way and this would not be arson. Arson is related to
criminal intent and a Police definition and not a fire
service categorisation.
Sometimes, it is not possible to determine a motive,
particularly where a fatality is involved. In such cases,
the motive may be recorded as ‘not known’. As a
general rule, fires and fire deaths where the motive is
‘not known’ are usually counted with accidental fires.
So, accidental dwelling fires will include a small
number of fires where the motive cannot be
determined with any reliability.
For fires where there were fire related fatalities,
around three quarters (75 per cent) of these fires
(based on the average over the ten years to 2022)
were of accidental motive. Only 16 per cent were of
deliberate motive. The numbers vary each year. In
2011 and 2019, for example, fires with a fire related
fatality of deliberate motive peaked at a third (33 per
cent) of all fatal fires.

Fire deaths in the London boroughs
(Tables 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6)
The trend in the number of fire deaths in individual
boroughs may vary from the London-wide downward
trend. Fire deaths are relatively indiscriminate events;
there is no discernible pattern by borough.
Inner and outer London
(Tables 2.3 and 2.4)
Looking at the number of fires with fire related
fatalities, there are slightly more in outer London than
in inner London. Over the five years to 2022, 58 per
cent of fires were in outer London with 42 per cent in
inner London.
16
The position over the same period for fire fatalities, is
that 41 per cent were in inner London and 59 per cent
in outer London.
(Table 2.5 and 2.6)
There is a relatively indiscriminate pattern of fire
deaths across individual London boroughs. The
boroughs with the largest and fewest numbers of fires
with fire related fatalities are set out in the tables
below.

Property types
(Table 2.7)
Primary fires where people die are categorised as
those in buildings (dwellings, other residential or non-
residential), outdoor or transport:
• Dwellings include all types of private residences
and homes. It covers houses, flats, houses in
multiple occupation (HMOs) and self-contained
sheltered housing.
• Other residential covers places of communal
living and where people receive care, like
residential care homes. It also includes short term
accommodation residential accommodation like
student halls, hostels and hotels.
• Non-residential includes all types of commercial
building as well as private outdoor structures and
outhouses.
• Outdoor includes grass, open land and
woodland.
• Transport includes motor vehicles, boats, trains
and aircraft.
Where a building has one or more uses, we record the
property type for the area where the fire started; for
example, where a fire occurs in a shop with a flat
above, we would record a fire in a shop.
Most people who die in a fire die in their home. The
number of dwelling fire deaths outnumbers fire
deaths in other locations by a significant margin. This
drives our focus on community safety work to help
keep people safe in their homes.

Chart 6: Fire deaths by property type, five year
average to 2022
Accidental dwelling fires with fire related
fatalities
(Table 2.8)
Accidental dwelling fires are categorised into four
property types:
• Dwellings which includes single occupancy
house or bungalow, self contained sheltered
housing, caravan/mobile home.
• Purpose built flats or maisonettes, which are
designated by how tall the building is (up to three
storeys, between 4 and 9 storeys, and 10 or more
storeys).
• Converted flats and maisonettes, of either up
to 2 storeys or 3 storeys or more.
• Houses in multiple occupation, by how many
storeys and whether licensed or unlicensed.
Dwellings and Purpose built flats/maisonettes
accounted for 44 and 38 per cent respectively of
accidental dwelling fires with fire related casualties.
Around half of the population of London live in flats3
.
Over the five past years purpose built flats/
maisonettes that had up to three storeys, accounted
for 15 per cent of purpose built flats/maisonette fires
with fire related casualities, between 4 and 9 storeys

slightly more (17 per cent) and 10 or more storeys
accounted for less than five per cent.

Hour of the day
(Table 2.11 and 2.12)
We do not consistently capture the actual time of
death from a fire. We can say when we were notified
about a fire and the times in this section are based on
‘time of call’ to the fire. Someone injured in a fire may
not die at the time, and a death may be some days or
weeks after the fire.
The pattern by hour of day fluctuates throughout the
day.

Where fires with fatalities start
We record the point within the location where a fire
starts. This may not be where a casualty dies (for
example a fire might start in the kitchen, but the
resulting fire causes a fatality in a bedroom).
19
Room in dwelling where fatal fires started
(Table 2.13)
Our report Fires in Greater London, shows that most
of the dwelling fires in recent years happen in the
kitchen.
Whilst most fires start in a kitchen, these fires are less
likely to be fatal. Most dwelling fires with fatalities
happen in a living room, followed by the bedroom.
However, in some of these incidents, the living room
was also being used as a bedroom. Over the last five
years to 2022, bedrooms and living rooms resulted in
33 and 40 percent respectively for all fatal fires in
dwellings.

fires by location of fire start, five year average to

Other locations where fatal fires started
(Table 2.14)
Although there are very few fires resulting in fire
related fatalities outside the home, there is a relatively
wide spread across different locations with only,
perhaps, garages as a place where fires involving fire
fatalities occur repeatedly.
Source of ignition
(Tables 2.15 and 2.16)
Smoking related source of ignition at fires where there
is a fire related casualty accounts for 25 per cent of all Chapter 3 | Characteristics of the people who die in the home
This chapter looks at the characteristics of people who
die in the home.
Why people die in fires
The factors that influence the chances of a fire
casualty becoming a fire fatality are complex. Some of
the main contributors include:
• how able the person was to respond to the fire
(i.e. were they mobile; were they awake; were
they impaired by drugs or alcohol);
• how early the fire is discovered;
• how quickly the brigade is called;
• the materials involved in the fire;
• the size and construction of the room/building;
• the proximity of the victim to the fire;
as well as the arrival time and response of the brigade.
The Grenfell Tower fire
The fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017 has changed
the profile of the people who die in fires from the
trends that have been seen in the years before. Most
of the people who died at Grenfell were under 65
(years) and many were of black and minority ethnic
origin. However, the information the LFB has
recorded about the Grenfell victims has been supplied
by the Metropolitan Police Service and is the only
information that has been made publicly available. At
this time, that includes the age of the victims, but not
the specific detail of their ethnic origins. This
information will be confirmed by the Grenfell Tower
Public Inquiry and the LFB will update its records at
that time.
Age of fire fatalities
(Table 3.1 and 3.2)
Over the last five years, 5 per cent of those who died
in fires were aged between 0 to 15 years, 46 per cent
of fire fatalities were of people within the 16 to 64 age
range, 46 per cent of fatalities were of those aged 65
and over and two per cent were unknown.The
proportion of older people who die in fires is higher
than the proportion of that age group within the
population for London. Around only 12 per cent of
Londoner’s are aged 65 and over.
Do you know the next fire fatality?
This is an older person aged 65 or over who lives alone.
Where they live, or the type of property, doesn’t matter.
However, their home will be unsafe from the risks of fire
and without adequate fire detection. They will have
reduced mobility and find it hard to walk unaided. As such,
they will spend most of their time in one room of their home
and often this can become a bed/sitting room. This person
is a smoker, uses candles or has other naked flames in their
home.
Other than a reduced mobility, this person also has other
health implications (such as dementia or Parkinson’s, for
example) which affects the primary senses, they could also
be at risk of neglect. They may have an impaired judgement
or become forgetful or disorientated; either through a
health issue, or as a result of their medication or from
drinking. There may be signs of previous fire ‘near misses’;
this could be cigarette burn marks on clothing or furnishing,
or scorch marks from cooking or using candles. This person
either receives, or would benefit from, some care and
support (from a local authority, relative or friend, or other
care provider). They would likely be a candidate for and not
currently in receipt of, or in receipt of telecare that is not
linked to smoke detection and reliant on a manual pendant.
Any combination of these factors can undermine the ability
of a person to react to a fire.
If you know a person who fits this description, they would
benefit from a home fire safety visit and you should contact
your local fire service.
This is the profile the LFB use to target its fire safety work in
people’s homes
33
Characteristics of the people who die in the home | Chapter 3
Gender of fire fatalities
(Table 3.4 and 3.5)
At LFB, data relating to gender is recorded as advised
by the police or the Coroner. On average over the last
five years to 2022, 61 per cent of those that died in
fire are male and 39 per cent female. When compared
to the 50/50 London gender demographic, this
suggests that men are more likely to be victims of fatal
fires than women. Ethnicity of fire fatalities
(Table 3.6 and 3.7)
On average over the last 5 years, 63 per cent of those
that died in fire were white, while 36 per cent were
from other minority ethnic groups. This compares
with the London ethnic demographic which is around
54 per cent white and 46 per cent other ethnic
origin54
.
2022 Case Study
The following incident took place in 2022 and
highlights the key characteristics and issues that may
contribute to a fatal fire.
Mrs D was 85 years old. In her later years Mrs D’s
mobility had declined and she had become
bedbound. In addition to this she had been diagnosed
with a number of health conditions including
Osteoarthritis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD), Asthma and Insomnia. She was also
visually impaired and experienced pain across her legs
following a back injury some years ago, it was
reported that she was bedbound. Due to Mrs D’s
medical conditions, she was in receipt of a formal care
package, which consisted of four care visits per day.
The care she received assisted with personal care,
meals preparation, administering medication, general
housekeeping and shopping. In 2021, following a
HFSV conducted by the LFB, the care provider made a
4 2021 Census

Characteristics of the people who die in the home | Chapter 3
referral to the Care Quality Commission raising
concerns about Mrs D neglecting herself and refusing
personal care as detailed in her care plan. They also
raised concerns about Mrs D’s smoking, she was a
smoker of both manufactured cigarettes and also
smoked cannabis in the evening to manage pain.
Evidence of the unsafe use and disposal of smoking
materials was found on numerous items of clean
bedding. Mrs D was known to a number of partner
agencies, after conducting a visit at Mrs D’s property
agencies recommended that a fire-resistant ashtray
and fire extinguisher be purchased as Mrs D smoked
in bed.
Mrs D lived alone in her privately owned three-
bedroomed, mid terrace house. Mrs D’s limited
mobility meant she was unable to access the first floor
of the property and as a result the living room on the
ground floor had been converted into a bedroom.
Three smoke alarms were installed in the property,
one was in the room of origin, one was in the hallway
outside the front room and the other was located on
the landing of the first floor. They actuated at the time
of the fire and raised the alarm. It is believed that
these alarms were installed by the LFB during a
number of HFSV’s conducted at the property. In total
four HFSV had been conducted at the property the
first took place in 2013 following a referral from Mrs
D’s occupational therapist. In November 2015 she
declined an arranged HFSV. Following this, three
further visits were conducted in 2017, 2021 and
another in 2021.
The last HFSV conducted was carried out after the
Brigade was called to a Special Service Incident at the
address. Whilst still at the scene, the attending crew
carried out a full HFSV and installed an additional
smoke alarm in Mrs D’s front room. They also
identified a number of significant risks including Mrs
D living alone, being over 80, smoking, having
mobility impairments, as well as visual and age-related
impairments. These characteristics made Mrs D
vulnerable to experiencing, reacting to and escaping a
fire and as a result raised a person at risk referral
(PAR), flame retardant bedding was recommended.
A telecare system was found in the property, this
consisted of a base unit, pendant alarm and bed/chair
sensor, however it wasn’t linked to smoke detection.
This was installed in 2014 following a referral from
social services. The telecare system was activated the
day before the fire and was reportedly malfunctioning
that evening. It was tested following the incident and
worked correctly.
On the evening of the incident Mrs D received two
visits one at 19:00 from her carer lasting 30 minutes.
At 10:15 Mrs D received the last visit of the evening;
this was from her neighbour who regularly helped
Mrs D take her medication. They remained at the
property for 15 minutes. Five minutes later another
neighbour heard an alarm sounding and shouts for
help coming from Mrs D’s property. They investigated
and discovered a fire in the front room on the ground
floor. Aware that neighbours who had previously
visited Mrs D that evening had keys to the property
they knocked on their door and alerted them to the
fire. Upon gaining entry to Mrs D’s front door, they
entered the property but were unable to access the
front room due to the heat and smoke.
The first call was made to Brigade Control by a
neighbour just before 23:00 hours reporting the fire
within the property and an elderly person known to
be inside. Upon arrival crews could see smoke issuing
from the front door. After gaining entry into the
property they extinguished a fire in the front room on
the ground floor and located the body of Mrs D. She
had sustained injuries incompatible with life and was
pronounced recognition of life extinct (ROLE) by
attending paramedics.
The cause of the fire is believed to be the unsafe use
of smoking materials.

Introduction
This Fire Facts report sets out the key information on
our response times to the 999 calls we receive. Most
of the data in this report begins from 2005, as before
this period the data we captured about response times
was less accurate and is not directly comparable to the
most recent data.
About the London Fire Brigade
The London Fire Brigade (LFB) is the fire and rescue
service for the Greater London area. The LFB is run by
the London Fire Commissioner (LFC) who is the fire
and rescue authority for London1
.
Over the period covered by this report (2005-2022)
the London Fire Brigade has attended just over
100,000 incidents each year within London of which
around half are false alarms. In 2022, we also
attended 703 incidents in neighbouring county areas
(at their request). In this report we focus on those
incidents that happen within the boundaries of
Greater London. Fire engines from neighbouring
counties also attend some incidents in London (when
requested); in this report we focus on the response
provided by LFB fire engines as we don’t have data for
the incidents attended by fire engines from other
Brigades.
The Brigade sets out how its prevention, protection
and response activities will best be used to mitigate
the impact of risk on communities, in a cost effective
way, in its Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP).
The most recent plan, known as ‘Your London Fire
Brigade’ was approved in January 2023. The Brigade
also publishes a Local Assessment of Risk in London
which is available on the LFB website – here to look at
how we understand risk in different areas of London.
Data sources and systems
Information about the 999 calls we receive is recorded
in the LFB’s mobilising system. Between February
1 The LFC replaced the former London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority (LFEPA) on 1 April 2018.
LFB | Incident response times 2022
Introduction
1990 and May 2004, the Brigade used a mobilising
system (Marconi) that did not report attendance times
by minute and second, so an incident where a fire
engine was mobilised at 0850h 05s and arrived at
0855h 50s would record an attendance time of five
minutes, even though the elapsed time was actually
five minutes and 45 seconds. This means that
reported performance against the attendance
standards prior to 2004 was better than actual
performance to incidents.
In May 2004 the Brigade changed to the Motorola
ProCAD mobilising system which records times in
minutes and seconds. Because of this discontinuity in
data, this report shows the data from 2005 as this is
the first complete year with accurate response time
data. Data for call handling is also only available since
May 2004 when the ProCAD system was introduced.
The Brigade changed mobilising system again during
2015 with a system based on the Capita (Fortek)
Vision product. There is continuity of data between
the Vision and ProCAD mobilising systems. The new
Vision system went live at 2am on 17 November 2015.
Key data about the incidents we attend is passed from
the mobilising system to our Incident Management
System (IMS). In IMS, crews and others add
additional data to create the main incident record. IMS
conforms to the requirements of the government’s
national incident recording system (IRS) which the
Brigade adopted in November 2008.
We undertake a range of data quality checks and data
improvement processes. However, there are still
some data in our systems that we believe contain
errors. For example some times are obviously wrong
(due to failure to use the fire engine recording
systems at the appropriate time), and some arrival
v
Introduction
times are not available. For this reason a small quantity
of data is excluded from the analysis (see Annex B).
Fire stations and fire engines
The London Fire Brigade’s response to emergencies is
provide by fire appliances (fire engines), other
specialist vehicles and fire officers. This Fire Facts
publication focusses on the response by fire engines
only. The London fire brigade also has a river station
in Lambeth with a river boat, the appliances and
response times are not included in this report. All fire
engines are based at fire stations, and the number of
fire stations and fire engines has fluctuated over the
period cover by this report. The location of fire
stations and fire engines will determine the Brigade’s
speed of response to emergencies.
The numbers of fire stations and fire engines in
London (at end December each year) is set out
below. Chapter 1 | Responding to emergencies
The Brigade plans the allocation of its resources on a
London-wide basis. This means that we plan the
location of fire engines (and other resources) so they
can arrive at incidents as quickly as possible, wherever
the incident occurs in London.
In 2022 London Fire Brigade worked with
communities in London to create a Community Risk
Management Plan called ‘Your London Fire Brigade’
this plan replaces the London Safety plan from
previous years. The plan was created to ensure our
plan reflected on communities priorities and concerns.
It describes how we’ll better engage, protect, learn
from, and represent London’s communities over the
coming years. ‘Your London Fire Brigade’ meets our
requirement under the Fire and Rescue national
framework for England to produce what they call an
Integrated Risk Management Plan. One of the most
important things this plan does is reflect our
Assessment of Risk in London and what we will do to
help reduce and respond to that risk. In the past, we
have called this the London Safety Plan (Your London
fire Brigade) 2023-2029.
The Brigade’s view is that in the event of a serious
incident, each person should be entitled to expect a
broadly similar response in terms of resources
deployed and the time to arrive. Just because a person
lives in an area with a lower likelihood of fire
occurring, this does not mean that they should have a
slower response time when a fire actually does occur.
We now call this approach the “principle of equal
entitlement”. This is a guiding but not overriding
principle when we plan our services because it is
subject to a number of other objectives and
operational constraints.
The Brigade may send a different number of fire
engines and appliances to an incident depending on
the nature of the incident and the type of building or
location. The number of appliances sent to different
types of incident as an initial response to an
emergency (‘999’) call is called the “pre-determined
attendance” (PDA). For example, the PDA for a
LFB | Incident response times 2022
dwelling fire is always two fire engines. For complex
buildings, or where there are complicated firefighter
logistics to take into account, the PDA might be
higher. For example, a call to a fire at the British
Museum has a PDA of four fire engines, an aerial
appliance and a command unit, and a fire at the
Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street has
a PDA of four appliances and one aerial appliance.
Our response standards
So we can see how well we are performing, we set
standards for various parts of the process for getting
resources to emergency incidents. The current
standards were confirmed or put in place by the ‘Your
London Fire Brigade’ Plan 2023 (Your London fire
Brigade) Which was the subject of public consultation
during 2022, and was approved in January 2023.
These indicators start at the of the arrival of a fire
engine with crew at the incident scene. Targets are
now mainly focused on response times, though we
will continue to monitor 999 calls internally.
Our response time targets for 2022 were:
(a) (b) (c) (d) for the first fire engine to arrive within an average
of six minutes from being dispatched
for the second fire engine (if required) to arrive
within an average of eight minutes from being
dispatched
for a first fire engine to arrive within 10 minutes
in more than 90 per cent of occasions.
for the second fire engine to arrive within 12
minutes in more than 95 per cent of occasions.

Responding to emergencies | Chapter 1
The emergency response process
For all emergencies, and particularly for fires, there is a
period between the incident happening and the time
the fire brigade is called which is outside the control of
the fire brigade. This is an important period because
an undiscovered fire which may have been burning
for some time before discovery can result in a worse
outcome. It is during this period that smoke alarms
and escape plans are very important so that early
warning of fire is given and occupants have the
chance to escape.
The diagram that follows shows the key stages in
responding to and dealing with an emergency call
from the time that an emergency happens to the time
LFB arrives at the incident scene with vehicles and
firefighters to resolve the emergency.
Emergency happens
Getting to the incident quickly is important, but so is
the work we do when we get there. On arrival our
crews carry out a dynamic risk assessment of the
situation to ensure that they and any members of the
public are safe. This assessment will also include a
plan of operations to resolve the situation in the most
effective way. When the incident has been bought
under control the incident commander at the scene
sends a ‘stop message’ to control which tells them that
additional strengthening resources are not required.
The incident may still continue for several minutes,
hours or even days, but at the time of the stop
message, the incident is contained. The incident is
closed when the last resource at the scene leaves and
returns to its base location. Chapter 2 | Discovery of the fire and calling the fire brigade
This chapter looks at the key actions, in advance of
calling 999, that are necessary for the swift attendance
of the Brigade to deal with any emergency and are
vital for the avoidance of casualties. These are: the
discovery of the emergency/fire by a member of the
public or an automated alarm system and the brigade
being called via 999.

The importance of calling the fire brigade
early
Fires behave very differently and the rate of fire
growth depends on a range of factors such as the
material and quantity of items in the room and how
big the room is. Some fires develop very quickly and
others can smoulder for several hours before the fire
fully develops. Those that do develop into more
serious fires can do so very quickly and the fire can
become very hostile in a few minutes from the start.
Fires in the home are not often serious, but when they
are, early warning (e.g. smoke alarms) and evacuation
(and fire suppression systems such as sprinklers) are
vitally important.
Delay between fire start and 999 call
(Table 2.1)
1 in 5 fires in the home are discovered immediately
with there being no delay in the Brigade being called
(20 per cent). For 1 in 3 fires, the delay between
discovering the fires and calling 999 is more than 10
minutes (32 per cent).
Chart 1: Delay between fire start and 999 call for
dwelling fires (5year average – 2018 to 2022)
The actions which are outside the control of the
brigade are (a) the time between the ignition of the
fire to its discovery and (b) from the discovery to
calling the fire brigade.
We don’t always know how long it has taken for the
Brigade to be called, but when we attend fires our
crews and fire investigators use their knowledge of
fire development and information from any people
present to determine how long it has been between
the fire being discovered and the 999 call being made.
The Brigade knows from analysis of this information
that the time taken from the ignition of a fire to the
time the brigade is called can have a greater impact on
the fatality rate in dwelling fires than the arrival time of
the fire appliances.

Discovery of the fire and calling the fire brigade| Chapter 2
Over the last five years, the percentage of dwelling
fires where the 999 call was made without delay
increased slightly in 2022 to 1 in 5 fires. It was thought
to be a knock on effect of the lockdown. However
over the last 5 years the percentage of dwelling fires
where the 999 call was made without delay has
increased by at least 1 per cent each year. Chapter 3 | Emergency call handling
This chapter deals with activity undertaken by LFB
control room staff, who take and deal with emergency
(999) calls and mobilise resources to deal with
emergencies.
Our control room handles many more emergency calls
than actual emergencies that we need to attend. In
recent years, around 40 per cent of these calls did not
result in an emergency response as the call was either
not an emergency, or the call was a duplicate
reporting of an emergency we were already dealing
with.
Chart 2: Number of 999 calls received, including the
proportion that resulted in attendance at an incident.
This chapter covers the interval marked in bold on
the chart below.

999 Call received
Call answered Location confirmed
Fire engine(s) respond
Crew turn-out Travel to incident

Emergency resolved

When a member of the public dials 999 (or the
European 112 number) they are first connected to the
public emergency call service (PECS) who asks
“Emergency. Which service?”. The PECS’s for the UK
and London is BT plc which provides the 999/112
emergency call handling service. BT, which has been
the sole PECS provider since 2014, is obliged, under
the terms of its licence, to provide a public emergency
call service by which any member of the public can
contact (without charge) any of the local emergency
authorities (police, fire, ambulance, coastguard).
If the 999 caller asks for “Fire Brigade”, the call is
transferred from the PECS to the LFB control
operators based at our London Operations Centre in
Merton.

Answering a 999 call
(Table 3.1 and 3.2)
In 2007 it took 4.6 seconds, on average, for an LFB
control operator to answer a 999 call when it was
passed from the PECS. Call answer times fell between
2007 and 2014 and in 2013 the average time taken to
answer a call was down to 1.5 seconds.
Since 2015, it has taken slightly longer to answer calls;
this is due to the facility that automatically distributes
calls within the control room, not being available when
we changed mobilising system in 2015. Automatic call
distribution was reintroduced in July 2018 and the
average time to answer a call fell to 3.4 seconds. By
2021, the average time to answer a call was 3.0
seconds and in 2022, the call answer time increased
slightly to 4.3 seconds.

To ensure that we don’t have many calls that have
unusually extended call answering times, we monitor
the percentage of calls that are answered within seven
seconds.
The occasions when it takes longer than seven
seconds to answer a call are those when we have
exceptionally high call demand which can happen
during very bad weather. For example, on Friday 18th
February 2022 control officers received 1,967
emergency calls in a 24 hour period as a result of the
adverse weather conditions brought about by ‘Storm
Eunice’.

Handling a 999 call
There are two stages to handling a 999 call:
• understanding the nature of the call and
confirming there is a real emergency; and
• confirming the address or location and then
dispatching a fire engine(s).
Control operators will handle calls that do not require
an attendance. A large number of these are duplicate
calls to incidents which are already being handled.
Others will be people who do not require a service the
Brigade offers, or where the Brigade has decided to
not make an attendance. Examples of these are
abandoned/hoax calls from public call boxes and
some calls to shut in lift releases or to automatic fire
alarms sounding where it is confirmed there is no
emergency, in line with our policies to filter or
‘challenge’ certain calls to ensure they need a Brigade
emergency response.
Confirming the location
(Table 3.3)
In recent years, it has taken, on average, just under a
minute to establish the details of the 999 call, confirm
the nature of the emergency and establish its location.
This time has been consistent over recent years,
remaining under 50 seconds.
7
Emergency call handling | Chapter 3
Dispatching (mobilising) fire engines
(Table 3.4)
The average time taken to dispatch a fire engine to an
incident once the location has been confirmed is
shown in table 3.4.
Call handling time
(Table 3.5)
The overall time taken to deal with an emergency 999
call, including the time to confirm the location of the
incident and the dispatch of a response, is called the
‘call handling time’. The total call handling time has
fluctuated in recent years, as it includes the time taken
by our Control staff, to filter or ‘challenge’ certain calls
to ensure they need a Brigade emergency response.
Since the go-live of our replacement mobilising
system in late 2015, which allows the use of
postcodes to find addresses, call handling times have
been slightly faster. In 2022, the average call handling
time was 1m 37s. Overall, call handling times have
generally improved since the introduction of our
current mobilising system in November 2015. Chapter 4 | Crew turn-out times
This chapter looks at the time it takes fire engine
crews to leave the fire station once they are mobilised;
we call this the ‘crew turn-out’ time. It deals with the
parts of the process marked on the chart below. As
can be seen from the chart, the crew turn-out time is a
key component (alongside travel time) of the overall
time it takes to get to an emergency incident.
Emergency happens
Alarm raised 999 call made
999 Call received
Call answered Location confirmed
Fire engine(s) respond
Crew turn-out Travel to incident
Arrive at scene
Action by Brigade Under control
Emergency resolved
Operations concluded Fire engine(s) returned
The time it takes crews to leave a station is an
important part of the process of getting to
emergencies as quickly as possible. We record and
measure the time it takes from (a) the LFB control
operator sending a mobilising message to the fire
station and (b) the fire engine crew getting the
message, putting on their fire gear (their personal
protective equipment), the driver to determine the
best way to the incident location and then leaving the
fire station with blue lights and sirens.
The time it takes for crews to turn-out does vary
between crews at different stations and this is because
the layouts of stations vary; it taking longer to get from
some parts of an older station to the fire engine than
other more modern stations.
Not all mobilisations happen from the fire station. Our
crews can be mobilised whilst they are out and about
LFB | Incident response times 2022
Crew turn-out times| Chapter 4
in their local area carrying out other work such as
home fire safety visits and familiarisation inspections.
Turn-out times
(Table 4.1)
The time it has taken a fire engine crew to turn-out
from a fire station is shown in the table below. Turn-
out times improved significantly after 2008 (to their
current levels) as during that time there was a focus
on making sure crews were turning out as quickly as
possible.
Chart 6: Average crew turn-out times
When we measure turn-out times for a fire station we
look at all incidents that station attends regardless of
where the incident is located. Turn-out times for the
London boroughs are, therefore, the times for the fire
engine crews located at fire stations in the borough
and not for the incidents that happen in the borough.
Although the layout of stations are different, the turn-
out times across London are similar. The average turn-
out time for stations by borough is shown in the table
below. Chapter 5 | Fire engine response times
This chapter looks at the time it takes for fire engines
to arrive at emergency incidents. It deals with the
parts of the process marked on the chart below.
Emergency happens
Alarm raised 999 call made
999 Call received
Call answered Location confirmed
Fire engine(s) respond
Crew turn-out Travel to incident
Arrive at scene
Action by Brigade Under control
Emergency resolved
Operations concluded Fire engine(s) returned
As explained in Chapter 1, our aim is to get to
emergencies as quickly as possible.
To measure our effectiveness at doing this, we have
three attendance standards that we monitor our
performance against. These standards have been in
place since 2022 (as part of Your London Fire Brigade)
and are:
(a) (b) (c) (d) for the first fire engine to arrive within an average
of six minutes from being dispatched
for the second fire engine (if required) to arrive
within an average of eight minutes from being
dispatched
for a first fire engine to arrive within 12 minutes
in more than 95 per cent of occasions
for a first fire engine to arrive within 10 minutes
in more than 90 per cent of occasions.
Our fire engine response standards are measured
from the time LFB control operators mobilise the first
(and subsequent) fire engine to an incident to when
the fire engine arrives at the incident location. This
LFB | Incident response times 2022
time therefore includes the crew turn-out time
detailed in Chapter 4 of this report.
We have used the time a resource is mobilised as the
reference point for attendance times for more than 20
years. Attendance times have traditionally been
counted from the point that resources are mobilised,
and this dates back to at least 1993 when the
government performance indicators measured speed
of response by reference to “assigning appliances by
control”.
The advantage of using the time mobilised as the
starting point for measuring the attendance time of
fire engines is that attendance standards are
calculated by reference to the period over which the
Brigade has most control.
Whilst the time between crew turn-out and arrival at
an incident may vary depending on traffic conditions
and marginal differences in crew turn-out times at
different stations, the time taken for the Brigade to
attend an incident will principally be determined by
the physical location of fire stations and fire engines.
Generally, inner London boroughs have faster
attendance times than outer London boroughs. This is
a consequence of a pre-existing (and continuing)
clustering of fire stations in inner London as a result of
the former government standards (see Annex A). This
historical position means that attendance times are
faster in inner London. A move towards equal
entitlement – which has been an objective since 2005
(see Annex A) – is more likely to result in attendance
times increasing in inner London and decreasing in
outer London. However, in terms of relative
performance the inner London boroughs still
generally have faster attendance times.
12
Response times for the first fire engine
(Table 5.1)
The standard for the first fire engine is to arrive at an
incident within six minutes (on average) of being
mobilised. The standard applies to London as a whole,
although we try to achieve it in each London borough
area, but at no other lower geography (e.g. ward). In
2022, the average first appliance attendance time was
5 minutes and 17 seconds.
Our London-wide performance is comfortably within
the standard, but a few boroughs fall outside the
target. The average time for inner London is slightly
faster than the time for outer London. The average
time by London borough will vary with most boroughs
within our published standard and only a few outside.
Chart 7: Average response time for the first fire
engine
Response times for the second fire engine.
(Table 5.2)
The standard for the second fire engine is to arrive at
an incident, on average, within eight minutes of being
mobilised. The standard also applies to London as a
whole, although we try to achieve it in each London
borough area, but at no other lower geography (e.g.
ward).

Chart 8: Average response time for the second fire
engine
Our London-wide performance is comfortably within
the standard, but a few boroughs fall outside the
target. The average time for inner London was faster
than for outer London. The average time by London
boroughs will vary, with most boroughs within the
published standard.
Response times for the third fire engine.
(Table 5.3)
Most incidents are quickly resolved by only one or
two fire engines. A third fire engine is sent to
incidents on about one in ten occasions. Other than
the overarching intention that all our fire engines
arrive as quickly as possible, there is no standard for
the third fire engine to arrive.

engine
On average it took about 7 minutes and 30 seconds
for a third fire engine to arrive at an emergency

incident in London in the past 5 years. The average
time for inner London was faster than the time for
outer London.
First fire engines arriving within 12 minutes
(Table 5.4)
Our third attendance standard is to get a fire engine to
an incident anywhere in London within 12 minutes on
95 per cent of occasions. This standard is to ensure
that no incident has an exceptionally protracted
attendance time.
London wide, we have achieved this standard on 98
per cent of occasions in each of the last 10 years.
First fire engines arriving within 10 minutes
(Table 5.5)
Our fourth attendance standard is to get a fire engine
to an incident anywhere in London within 10 minutes
on 90 per cent of occasions. This standard, together
with the 12 minute standard, is to ensure that no
incident has an exceptionally protracted attendance
time.
London wide, we have achieved this 10 minute
standard on over 96 per cent of occasions in each of
the last 10 years.
Attendance time distributions
(Tables 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8)
Measuring arrival times using an average is a useful
way of summarising our response to incidents.
Another way is to look at the distribution of response
times by minute intervals. These distributions (based
on data for the five years to 2022) help to understand
the range of response times.
There were some mobilisations that were over 20
minutes. These times are excluded from performance
attendance calculations as they represent errors in the
data: either due to human error, or failure with the
systems, in recording a correct time of arrival at the
incident (see Annex B table 8).

incidents quicker during this period. In the year after
the last lockdown, there has been more activity on
roads and more community activities taken on by fire
crews which has led to an increase in arrival times.
Delay Codes
(Tables 5.9 and 5.10)
There are various factors that could result in the
slowing down of our services. These are classified and
grouped into “delay codes”. Circumstances for these
delays can vary from poor weather conditions, traffic
or receiving an incomplete address (Table 5.9). The
attending crew can enter a delay code for any vehicle
where attendance was impeded, but they are actively
prompted to consider if there was an unnecessary
delay if the first fire engines takes more than six
minutes to arrive or the second fire engine takes more
than eight minutes to arrive.
Recent figures show that while there has been an
increase in delays recorded, fire crews have still been
able to attend incidents faster overall. For example,
the average first appliance attendance time has been 5
minutes and 10 seconds over the last five years to
2022.
National Lockdowns 2020 and 2021
Attendance times of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd fire engines
were quicker in 2020 than there had been over the
last 15 years. It is assumed that Covid – 19 may have
been a factor, with many community activities that are
carried out by the fire engines crews being cancelled,
more fire engines have been available and ready to
respond to incidents. In addition, with less people
commuting to work and less children attending
schools, fire engines will have been able to travel to Chapter 7 | Incident durations
This chapter looks at the overall time it takes from a
999 call being made to the incident being fully
resolved and all the fire engines and fire investigators
leaving the scene.
Emergency happens
Alarm raised 999 call made
999 Call received
Call answered Location confirmed
Crew turn-out Fire engine(s) respond
Travel to incident
Arrive at scene
Action by Brigade Under control
Emergency resolved
Operations concluded Fire engine(s) returned
The time taken to fully conclude operations cannot
always be taken as a sign of how severe an emergency
was. There are many actions we carry out after the
emergency has been resolved but before we leave the
scene. For example after a fire we will stay to help an
occupier restore or secure their property. Incidents
where we carry out investigations will also have longer
durations.
Fire incidents
(Table 7.1 and 7.2)
On average it takes around an hour to conclude a fire
incident. Some fire types, such as small outdoor fires
(which typically involve rubbish and bin fires), can be

Aerial Firefighting: Technologies, Strategies, and Operational Procedures

Aerial firefighting combines aircraft and advanced technologies to support ground crews in detecting, monitoring, and suppressing fires. This guide covers platforms like fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), describing how each is deployed across different fire scenarios. It examines tactical approaches for wildland, grassland, urban-interface, and industrial fires, and explains detailed procedures for aerial drops, crew transport, and logistics. We also explore how weather, terrain, and visibility shape decisions in the air and on the ground. Each section is structured with clear headings and concise paragraphs, plus ordered or bullet lists for key steps and considerations, to form an in-depth operational guide.
Fire Types and Tactical Approaches

Different fire environments demand tailored aerial strategies. Key fire categories include wildfires, grassland (prairie) fires, urban-interface fires, and industrial or structure fires. The type of fuel, terrain, and proximity to people or facilities affect the choice of aircraft, suppression agents, and mission tactics. Aerial resources may focus on slowing the fire’s spread, targeting hotspots, or protecting assets depending on the context.
Wildland/Wildfires
Environment: Wildfires burn forests, brush, and other natural vegetation. They often occur in remote or rugged terrain and can spread quickly under hot, dry, and windy conditions.
Objectives: The aerial goal is usually to contain the fire perimeter and reinforce control lines until ground crews secure the fire. Early detection and mapping allow quick response before a small ignition grows.
Tactics: Aircraft perform indirect attacks by dropping water or retardant along ridgelines and access routes to slow advancement. Successive drops create firebreak corridors that help ground teams cut lines. Aerial observation guides where to deploy resources and can identify spot fires or flare-ups beyond the main front.
Coordination: Aerial tactics support large-scale incident operations. Air Attack or Air Tactical Supervisors manage multiple planes and helicopters. Spotter planes or airborne command units relay targets and adjust tactics in real time. Helicopters may deploy helitack crews (firefighters transported by helicopter) to construct line directly in tough spots.
Example Approaches: Common practices include running parallel retardant lines on flank of a fire (often along ridges or roads) and using helicopters to reconnoiter fire edge and lift water for precise drops on fiery hotspots. During extended incidents, fixed-wing airtankers may establish continuous shuttle-dropping operations from remote tanker bases.
Grassland and Prairie Fires
Environment: Grassland fires burn fine, dry grasses and light shrubs. They move very fast across open plains but typically burn out quickly.
Objectives: Suppression aims to quickly extinguish or control the spread before large areas are lost. Resources can often be concentrated in lines or backfire operations because of generally flatter terrain.
Tactics: Single-engine airtankers (SEATs) and helicopters make low-altitude runs to knock down fire edges. Because grass burns rapidly, multiple aircraft may work in tandem, creating parallel attack lines to encircle the fire. Aerial ignitions (using drip torches) can also set controlled burns to deprive the main fire of fuel.
Coordination: Fire spread is extremely weather-driven (especially wind). Pilots focus on attacking the active head of the fire while ground crews contain flanks. Medium or large fixed-wing tankers are less common unless the fire grows, so initial aerial response often relies on lighter aircraft that can turn quickly.
Example Approaches: In grassland fires, aircraft often execute frequent, shallow-water drops in quick succession. If wind shifts threaten communities, helicopters may dip in small lakes or haul portable pumps to deliver water directly on structures at the fire’s edge.
Urban-Wildland Interface Fires
Environment: Interface fires occur where wildlands meet built-up areas (homes, businesses, infrastructure). Fuels include vegetation near structures, fences, decks, and sometimes storage tanks. Wind patterns can be complex due to buildings and landscape features.
Objectives: Priority is protecting life and property. Aircraft work to establish defensible space around structures, cool burning buildings, and slow fire encroachment into neighborhoods.
Tactics: Precision matters. Helicopters may deliver water or foam directly onto structure hotspots or roof areas. Fixed-wing aircraft can lay retardant lines around neighborhoods or ahead of the fire line. Drones and forward scouts identify fires encroaching on homes or any new ignition points quickly.
Coordination: Operations are usually closely integrated with local fire departments. Aircrews must avoid populated areas when dropping to prevent flying debris and ensure all civilians are evacuated from drop zones. Communication is critical: aircraft relay which structures are threatened and where ground crews should concentrate.
Example Approaches: Pre-deployment of skimmers or local tankers is common when a fire threatens an interface community. Urban firefighting drones equipped with thermal cameras may scan behind barriers or within school perimeters. If industrial or high-risk facilities (like chemical plants or oil fields) lie near wildland, specialized foam or retardant may be used to cool equipment and fuel sources.
Industrial and Structure Fires
Environment: Fires in industrial sites, chemical plants, refineries, or large buildings involve flammable liquids, gases, or hazardous materials. These fires can erupt in complex facility layouts.
Objectives: The immediate priority is preventing catastrophic explosions, containing hazardous runoff, and protecting human life. Aerial assets provide support for overall cooling and indirect control.
Tactics: Often, the aerial role is supportive rather than primary. Helicopters may drop foam to blanket burning pools or large tanks (though ground monitors usually handle most of the firefighting). Smokejumper and helitack helicopters can insert fire crews onto rooftops or tight industrial zones inaccessible by land. Fixed-wing tankers might drop water to cool debris or nearby fuel stores, but this requires careful coordination to avoid spreading contaminants.
Coordination: Multi-agency coordination is crucial. Local emergency services usually lead, and aerial operations integrate under an Incident Command System (ICS) structure. Safety corridors are established for aircraft to approach targets. Specialized teams may treat discharged water (which can be toxic) and monitor air for chemical exposure.
Example Approaches: If a chemical plant fire threatens to reach storage tanks, helicopters may perform targeted foam drops on the worst areas. Drones fitted with gas sensors or cameras can survey for leaking pipelines. In some cases, military or industrial firefighting planes loaded with foam concentrate have been used to blanket large-scale petrochemical fires.
Aerial Platforms and Technologies

Modern aerial firefighting employs a range of aircraft and support systems. Each platform has strengths and limitations. This section examines operational aspects of drones (UAVs), helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and emerging technologies (airships, high-altitude platforms) in firefighting roles.
Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
Drones have become essential tools in firefighting, primarily for intelligence gathering, early detection, and situational awareness. Most firefighting drones carry cameras, sensors, or communications gear rather than water. Key points include:
Detection and Surveillance: Fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones equipped with optical and infrared (IR) cameras scan large areas for smoke or thermal hotspots. They can launch quickly from staging areas to locate new fires or spot flare-ups beyond accessible roads. For example, specialized drones can execute automated flight paths over forests at dawn to detect lightning-caused ignitions when aircrews are limited by darkness or fog.
Real-Time Monitoring: Drones relay live video and heat maps to incident command. They hover or circle over a fire front to gauge intensity and movement. This real-time data supplements satellite or manned-aircraft imagery, especially in poor visibility. Operators often fly drones to relay communications or act as aerial platforms for mobile networks (cellular or radio repeaters) at remote fires.
Precision Support: Smaller drones can be directed to specific tasks, such as mapping a fire perimeter or verifying containment lines. Thermal drones can search embers at night, guiding firefighters to hot spots. Emerging drone swarms (groups of cooperating UAVs) use AI to distribute the workload: some drones illuminate the fire (IR scanning), others map terrain in 3D, and a central command drone synthesizes the data. High-altitude pseudo-satellites or long-endurance planes can serve as command hubs directing these smaller UAVs.
Suppression Applications: Most drones lack capacity to drop much water or retardant (payloads are usually under 10–100 liters for small drones). However, heavy-lift UAVs under development can carry hundreds of kilograms. For instance, multi-rotor drones with 400 kg capacity are being tested to carry water buckets or foam by air. Concepts include autonomous drones that fly through the night to mop up remnant flames when manned aircraft must ground. Additionally, specialized drone models can shoot fire-retardant pellets or use compressed gas to create local firebreaks, although these techniques are still experimental.
Swarming and AI: Cutting-edge programs aim to coordinate fleets of drones for continuous coverage. AI onboard can segment smoke and fire from background in real time, prioritize targets, and even predict fire spread. Data fusion from multiple sensors (visual, IR, multispectral, LIDAR) improves situational awareness. All this happens with minimal human input, potentially letting drones autonomously patrol fire-prone regions and raise the alarm.
Limitations: Drones face constraints: battery life (unless tethered or solar-powered), vulnerability to heat/smoke, and regulatory hurdles (airspace permits, BVLOS rules). Smoke and ash can obscure camera views. Helicopter downwash or electromagnetic interference can disrupt drone signals. Safety protocols often require drones to stand down if manned aircraft are nearby. Unauthorized drones by hobbyists have even forced grounding of active firefighting planes. Managing civilian drone activity is now a major coordination task.
Helicopters
Helicopters are agile rotary-wing aircraft widely used in firefighting for water and retardant drops, crew transport, reconnaissance, and logistical support. They excel at operating in rugged terrain and at low altitudes. Key features include:
Water and Retardant Drops: Many helicopters carry an external bucket (commonly a Bambi Bucket) or an internal belly tank. A bucket is lowered on a cable and filled by hovering over a water source (lake, river, pond, or portable pool). Water is then dropped in a targeted plunge. Belly tanks allow faster refills (no dipping required) but add permanent weight. Helicopter pilots make precise, vertical drops or fan-pattern drops on intense hotspots. Helicopters are often used for “mop-up” tasks: following larger air attacks to extinguish smoldering areas.
Crew and Cargo Transport: Helicopters deploy helitack crews—teams of wildland firefighters—to hard-to-reach locations. Personnel may rappel or fast-rope to the ground from hovering helicopters. Helicopters also lift tools, fuel, chain saws, supplies, and portable pumps into the fire zone. Sling-load missions carry big equipment or even vehicles to forward bases. Emergency medevac (short-haul) operations can extract injured firefighters or civilians by winch or long-line, sometimes under fire conditions.
Types of Helicopters: Models vary from small scout helicopters (e.g. 4-seat light helicopters) to heavy-lift rotorcraft. Common firefighting types include: tandem-rotor helitankers (e.g. Sikorsky S-64 AirCrane) that can carry over 3,700 liters of water; medium helicopters (e.g. Bell 205/212, UH-1 variants, 2,300-liter capacity) often used for backup drops and crew moves; and smaller helicopters (e.g. MD 500, Kamov) for reconnaissance or urban use. The choice depends on mission: large helitankers require prepared helispots, smaller ones can land almost anywhere.
Drop Techniques: Helicopters approach drop sites much slower and lower than fixed-wing aircraft. A typical process is:
Fill: Hover over water or line up with a dip-source, fill bucket/tank.
Transit: Fly to target, often under 100 knots.
Aim: Pilot aligns on the drop point, sometimes using laser or visual cues.
Release: Open the bucket’s valve or pump out water, usually at a low altitude for accuracy.
Safety Checks: Observers or spotters may stand by to confirm drop accuracy and that the bucket is clear of obstacles.
Advantages: Helicopters can hover, loiter, and turn in place. They can operate in valleys and near buildings. They do not need runways and can refuel at small helibases. Some helicopters scoop water automatically from rivers on the fly. Helicopters can also drop foam and other fire suppressants if fitted with tanks and pumps.
Challenges: Helicopter operations are heavily impacted by smoke and updrafts. Rotorcraft create strong downwash, which can stir up burning debris. Pilots must constantly adjust for wind gusts and thermals over fire. Night operations are limited (few agencies fly helicopters at night on wildfires due to darkness and smoke). Pilot fatigue and crew rotation are major concerns. Maintenance is intensive due to high operational tempo in dusty/smoky conditions.
Logistics Support: On multi-day incidents, helibases are established near the fire. They serve as hubs for fueling, maintenance, and crew briefing. Spare buckets, hoses, spare parts, and fuel trucks are essential. Crews also coordinate with air tanker base operations to share weather info and avoid conflicts.
Emerging Rotary Technologies: Autonomous flight systems are being tested in large helicopters. For example, experimental programs have equipped attack helicopters with onboard mission computers that can execute guided water drops with minimal pilot input. Some new eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) concepts are aimed at high-rise firefighting or urban supply runs. However, mainstream helicopter technology still relies on skilled pilots and established airframe designs.
Fixed-Wing Aircraft
Fixed-wing aircraft provide rapid, long-range response and deliver large volumes of water or retardant. Their higher speed and altitude capabilities complement helicopters. Main categories include:
Single-Engine Air Tankers (SEATs): Typically converted agricultural planes (e.g. Air Tractor AT-802) carrying 800–3,000 liters. Agile and able to operate from short, unimproved runways close to the fire. Used extensively for initial attack on small fires or to flank larger fires. SEATs drop water or foam to knock down flames until larger assets arrive.
Large Air Tankers (LATs): Multi-engine turboprops or jets modified for fire retardant (e.g. P2V Neptune, CL-215 series). Capacities range from 3,000 to 13,000 liters. They drop thicker retardant lines to slow fires in vegetation. Due to size, LATs operate from major airbases with runways. They provide end-to-end coverage: travel to fires hundreds of kilometers away, drop, then return for reload.
Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs): Converted airliners (e.g. DC-10, L-1011, or 747) and military transports (C-130). They can drop tens of thousands of liters of retardant or fire-fighting foam in one pass. VLATs usually handle the most critical sectors of very large wildfires. Many VLATs carry modular drop systems, allowing them to be refilled with retardant in minutes.
Retardant and Water Tanks: Fixed-wing aircraft typically use retardant (a colored slurry of water, fertilizer, and additives) on wildfires. Retardant forms a fire-retarding barrier on the ground. Some tanker aircraft also carry water or fire-retardant foam for very hot spots. Tank capacity and discharge mechanism vary by aircraft, but pilots compute release speed, altitude, and distance based on aircraft type and wind conditions.
Drop Runs: An attack run by a fixed-wing tanker is a planned sequence:
Pre-Flight: Mission briefing includes target location (often marked by GPS coordinates) and safe flight line.
Engagement: The tanker lines up perpendicular or at a calculated angle to the fire line to achieve desired drop shape (straight line, “skunk stripe,” or V-shaped pattern).
Drop: The pilot releases retardant at a predetermined point, usually flying 250–500 feet above ground for fixed wings. The aircraft’s speed and the wind determine how the retardant tracks and lands.
Exit: After release, the plane climbs away and is monitored until safe. Spotter aircraft often follow larger tankers to confirm drop accuracy.
Crew Transport: Fixed-wing planes generally do not carry firefighters to the scene (with few exceptions like military smokejumpers or Air Force pararescue). Instead, their role is dropping material. However, multi-mission aircraft can transport light cargo or serve as communication relays.
Advantages: Fast redeployment over long distances. Continuous dropping from VLATs can saturate large fire lines faster than helicopters. Fixed-wing planes burn more fuel but can carry much heavier loads per trip. Many are equipped with weather radars to navigate smoke and avoid storms.
Challenges: Require suitable runways for launch and landing. Heavily smoke-shrouded valleys can obscure targets, so drop accuracy may suffer. Fixed-wings have minimum drop altitudes (typically a few hundred feet) to allow safety margins, limiting precision in confined terrain. They also need well-coordinated radio communication with ground/air supervisors to avoid collisions.
Logistics: Major fires often mobilize national or international tanker fleets. Tanker bases must have fuel, retardant mixing facilities, and loading crews. Many countries maintain permanent “air tanker bases” in fire-prone regions or temporary tanker staging areas.
Other Aerial Technologies
Beyond traditional aircraft, several emerging or specialized technologies support firefighting:
Airships and Aerostats: Blimps or tethered balloons equipped with high-resolution sensors can hover over fires for prolonged observation. They offer stable platforms for infrared scanners and communications equipment. While they cannot drop water, they can provide real-time surveillance in areas where drones are impractical or at night when UAV operations are restricted.
High-Altitude Platforms: Long-endurance unmanned airplanes or balloons (like pseudo-satellites) can carry wide-area cameras or LiDAR to detect fires under cloud cover or before they spread. These do not typically interact directly with a fire but improve detection and forecasting.
Satellite Remote Sensing: Geostationary and polar-orbit satellites detect fires and smoke plumes at very large scale (hundreds of kilometers), useful for strategic planning. Fire satellites feed data to incident teams, but their resolution is coarse for tactical use.
Autonomous Aircraft: Some new concepts involve fully autonomous or remotely piloted craft performing drops. For example, modified jet transports under remote control have been demonstrated for retardant drops. Small autonomous fixed-wing drones could potentially drop micro-retardant spheres for fine control on small hot spots in future.
Technical Aids: Aircraft are increasingly equipped with on-board sensors like infrared mapping cameras, atmospheric sensors (air temperature, humidity, wind speed), GPS-guidance for retardant drops, and communications gear. Advances in datalink technology allow live video streaming from any aircraft to ground command centers. Night vision goggles and thermal imaging are now used in some air crews to continue operations after dark or through smoke.
Non-Drop Applications: Aircraft have also been used to sow firebreaks (e.g. arcing fire-starting pyrotechnics) or to deliver tools (like portable pumps or generators) via parachute. In some regions, flying lightning-seeding generators (silver iodide) have been tested to trigger precipitation.
Weather and Environmental Factors

Weather and local atmospheric conditions critically influence aerial firefighting strategy and safety. Pilots and incident planners constantly assess wind, temperature, humidity, and precipitation when making decisions. Key considerations include:
Wind: Perhaps the most influential factor. Wind speed and direction determine fire spread rate and direction. Strong winds can ground aircraft due to turbulence limits. Sudden gusts or downdrafts near ridges can violently shake or overturn helicopters. Wind also deflects water or retardant drops: pilots must adjust drop points upwind of target. When planning drops, crews account for wind drift by measuring it (using wind kits or observing smoke) and adjusting aim. High-altitude jet streams can shear large drops apart, so heavy winds aloft can reduce drop coherence.
Temperature: Hot daytime temperatures lower air density, reducing aircraft lift and engine performance. This limits maximum payload on takeoff (especially for helicopters at high altitudes). Heat also intensifies fires: large fires create convection columns, and ambient heat can make fires unpredictable. Pilots check density altitude charts: on a hot summer day at elevation, a helicopter may be unable to lift its bucket fully. Fuel planning may require offloading or fueling en route to compensate for reduced climb performance.
Humidity: Dry air (low humidity) allows fires to ignite and spread more rapidly because vegetation moisture is low. As humidity falls (especially below about 20-30%), the fire danger increases sharply. In very low humidity, even moderate winds can cause extreme fire behavior. Aircraft crews monitor humidity to predict fire “runs” (sudden growth). Conversely, higher humidity dampens fuels and slows fire spread, allowing safer and more effective drops. Humidity also affects fire retardant effectiveness; retardant formulas may need adjusting for very dry or very moist fuel conditions.
Precipitation and Storms: Rain is generally beneficial for firefighting, sometimes allowing a temporary halt in operations (since aircraft may not fly in heavy rain, or to let ground crews catch their breath). However, approaching thunderstorms pose dangers: lightning can start new fires, and downdrafts can destabilize low-flying aircraft. Even light rain can cause visibility issues or wet gear (though modern aircraft can fly in drizzle). Pilots avoid flying near storm cells or low clouds. In some cases, cloud-seeding from aircraft has been tested to induce rainfall, but this is rare operationally.
Smoke and Visibility: Thick smoke plumes severely reduce pilot visibility and obscure terrain. Smoke also carries particulate matter that can scratch windscreens and foul engines. Pilots often fly at night or twilight using infrared cameras to “see” through smoke, but many agencies restrict flights to daytime for safety. Smoke inversion layers can trap haze near the ground; helicopters operating in or under an inversion must fly without seeing the ground, which is hazardous. Teams use pre-flight briefings to mark smoke layers, and some modern aircraft have synthetic vision systems (SVS) or terrain awareness warning systems (TAWS) to prevent controlled flight into terrain.
Topography-Induced Weather: Mountainous and complex terrain creates localized weather conditions. For example, valleys can channel winds (like a funnel), increasing speed, while ridges create wind shear. Slope and elevation cause upslope winds by day and downslope cool winds at night. Sun-heated slopes produce strong updrafts (fire thermals), whereas shaded canyons may hold dense smoke. Pilots must consider that a flight through a mountain pass in the morning may encounter clear air, but by midday a buildup of smoke and heat can make flying treacherous. When a fire generates its own convection, it can form pyrocumulus clouds; if these develop into pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb), they bring powerful updrafts and lightning, which are extremely dangerous for aircraft. Incident meteorologists (IMETs) are often assigned to large fires to analyze these dynamics and advise air crews.
Weather forecasts and on-site measurements are integrated into every aerial firefighting plan. Pre-flight and in-flight weather briefings ensure pilots choose safe altitudes, fuel loads, and routes. Incident teams use meteorologists’ data to predict fire growth and align resources. Regular updates account for changing conditions, since a strategy that works in the morning may need alteration as winds or humidity shift.
Challenges and Coordination in Aerial Operations

Aerial firefighting operations face many practical challenges. Effective strategy requires managing terrain difficulties, communication protocols, airspace control, and coordination between numerous units. This section outlines major operational challenges and how crews overcome them.
Topography and Access: Mountainous terrain not only affects weather, as noted, but physically restricts aircraft. Steep slopes limit approach angles, forcing higher drops that reduce accuracy. Narrow valleys may only allow one aircraft at a time. Many lakes and reservoirs are up on ridges or cliffs, requiring precise maneuvering to scoop. Mapping terrain in advance (often using digital elevation models) helps pilots choose safe corridors. Incident commanders often establish “no-fly zones” in canyons or gorge bottoms where rotorcraft cannot safely operate in swirling winds. Pilots are trained to avoid high-hazard maneuvers such as hovering on a slope or turning at low altitude with high banks.
Visibility and Smoke: As mentioned, thick smoke is a constant hazard. Reduced visibility increases the risk of mid-air collision between multiple aircraft or against terrain. Pilots maintain visual separation using established corridors: for example, fixed-wing tankers fly at assigned altitudes (often 1,500–3,000 ft above the fire), while helicopters stay much lower (500–1,000 ft) to attend to near-ground targets. All aircrews use agreed radio calls to announce positions (e.g. “Bambi bucket drop at 900 meters grid N-5”). Often a lead plane (or Air Tactical Supervisor in a small aircraft) circles overhead as an “eye in the sky,” observing the traffic pattern and directing other aircraft in turn. An aerial traffic manager (in voice or data link) sequences runs. Visual aids on the ground, like orange marker panels or lit markers at night, designate drop zones and refueling points.
Airspace Management: Large wildfires involve dozens of aircraft—firefighting planes, news helicopters, state or military aircraft, etc.—often in restricted airspace. Authorities quickly establish Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) around fire zones. Public aviation traffic is diverted, and only authorized aircraft with assigned roles may enter. A central authority (often an Air Attack Supervisor) coordinates all aerial movements. Each agency contributes to a Common Air Command: Civilian helicopters, military support, and even law enforcement coordinate on specified radio frequencies. Controllers ensure that drop patterns do not overlap. If local air traffic control is unavailable, a mobile Air Traffic Control team may be flown in to operate from a fire camp. The goal is to create a controlled airspace bubble where each aircraft has designated altitudes and tasks.
Communication Protocols: Standardized communication is essential. Pilots, air tactical units, and ground incident commanders use radio channels assigned by the incident management team. Terminology (often based on the Incident Command System (ICS) or national fire radio protocol) is standardized. For example, color-coded names (e.g. “Red 101” for a lead plane, “Blue 51” for a heli) help avoid confusion. Mission updates, such as “prepare to drop at next pass” or “target is secondary head,” must be unambiguous. Digital tools (like Automated Flight Following systems) track each aircraft’s GPS, allowing base to monitor who is where. In multi-national operations, liaison officers ensure that different language and protocol differences are bridged. Weather and fire behavior updates are pushed in real time via digital message systems (web portals, briefed apps) to all crews.
Coordination with Ground Crews: Aerial teams do not operate in isolation. They coordinate closely with ground firefighters who may be establishing line just ahead of or behind a drop zone. Air Attack planes survey fire progress and call in precise drop points to support infantry efforts. Helicopters often land supply and evac crews in tandem with ground strategy (for example, helitack crews might be inserted to build a fireline just behind a fixed-wing retardant drop). Unified command ensures that air drops do not endanger firefighters below; typically, ground personnel are cleared from drop zones before any load is released. Joint briefings are held daily for ground and air leaders to align tactics, especially when the fire behavior changes.
Legal and Safety Regulations: Aviation safety rules impose altitude and speed limits. For instance, helicopter flight above groups of people or congested areas is typically restricted. Pilots abide by minimum descent altitudes. Aircrews must wear fire-resistant gear, carry survival equipment, and maintain crew rest cycles to combat fatigue. Maintenance and inspection schedules for aircraft become more frequent under heavy use; a helicopter flying multiple drops per day will be inspected daily for rotor stress. Any incident, even minor, triggers safety stand-down and investigation.
Countering Unauthorized Drones: A growing modern challenge is unauthorized civilian drones near fires. Even one small quadcopter in a fire zone can force all aerial assets to ground until it is located and removed. Fire agencies work with aviation authorities to publicize no-fly warnings and use radars or spotters to detect illegal drones. Law enforcement may identify offenders. Preventative measures include issuing media advisories, drone-safety labels, and engaging hobbyist communities. Despite these efforts, unintentional intrusions remain an operational hazard.
Deployment Procedures and Tactics

This section outlines typical operational steps when deploying aerial assets. Procedures are standardized in many fire agencies, but local adaptations exist.
Helicopter Water and Retardant Drops
Helicopter drops require careful preparation and precision:
Pre-Mission Setup: The incident commander (IC) designates water sources and pre-approach routes. Pilots check bucket/tank calibration and altitude reference (gauges must be accurate for release). A net weight calculation is done: pilot knows how many liters or pounds of water can be safely carried given fuel load and altitude. Ground staff may mark helispots or lining up coordinates via GPS.
Scooping/Refilling: The helicopter approaches a water source in still air, hovers stably, and lowers the bucket. The pilot holds position until the bucket or tank fills automatically (often in 10–30 seconds). If multiple helicopters share one water body, teams rotate to maximize efficiency. Airports with helipads and water tanks are used if natural sources are not accessible.
Transit to Target: The pilot climbs to the pre-briefed drop altitude (often just above tree top level for better aim) and flies at a slow, constant speed toward the fire zone. They continually assess wind and smoke. The observer (if present) or lead plane confirms the target drop area.
Final Approach: On final leg, the pilot aligns with the target under instructor guidance (ground or air). Helicopters often have precise GPS or laser rangefinders to gauge distance. The pilot may fine-tune the line up manually.
Drop Release: The pilot releases water or retardant using a lever. The delivery is usually done at low altitude (e.g. 30–80 ft above treetops) for accuracy. For a bucket, releasing too high can cause water to disperse too widely; too low risks debris damage. For tanks, a timed bulk release can create a larger contained drop.
Egress and Safety: Immediately after release, the pilot must climb or bank away to avoid turbulence and maintain separation from the drop. Spotters confirm the drop outcome via radio or handheld cameras. If visual confirmation is negative (e.g. target smoke persists), another run is coordinated.
Repeat Cycle: Helicopters may circle back to the water source or a relay truck to reload. Ground crews flag any missed spots or ask for additional drops based on impact. Communication with the IC ensures support is focused on highest priorities.
Helicopter Crew Transport (Helitack) and Logistics
Helicopter transport of personnel and cargo follows additional steps:
Landing Zone (LZ) Identification: Ground teams select and clear small LZs near the fire. These are usually flat clearings where a helicopter can safely touch down. Sizes vary by helicopter footprint (from <30 ft diameter for light helos to >100 ft for super-transport helicopters). Rappellers also prepare ground platforms where they can attach to wires for quick insertion.
Insertion: Pilots approach the LZ hovering, then descend to land or hover for rappelling. Ground crew must stay clear of the downwash. The helitack crew enters quickly and may secure cargo.
Supply Drops: Helicopters may carry external loads on long lines (up to 100 m) for bulky items. Procedures include: ground personnel hook the cargo bag or net to the helicopter’s hook, and the pilot lifts vertical or drag it to the drop point. The helicopter then either lands to offload or releases the cargo via a winch.
Medical Evacuation: In medevac mode, helicopters lower medics with a hoist, retrieve patients onto stretchers, then lift out. Pilots follow FAA and medical guidelines to minimize jostling. Flights to hospital or staging medical areas are coordinated with emergency medical technicians on board.
Fixed-Wing Airtanker Operations
Fixed-wing drop runs involve the following:
Mission Planning: The air attack supervisor or IC prioritizes drop areas. Drop plans specify target grid coordinates, planned flight lines, and altitudes. If multiple tankers operate, spacing and sequencing are scheduled to avoid overlap. Pilots review topographic maps and wind forecasts.
Takeoff and Transit: Airtankers depart from their base at planned times. High-altitude jets may cruise at 25,000 ft to reach remote incidents, then descend as they approach. En route, pilots confirm weather and identify entry point to the incident area.
Positioning: Once in range, a lead plane or Air Tactical group communicates a vector to the tanker crew. The tanker adjusts heading and altitude to line up on the precise drop line. Tankers often approach perpendicular to ridgelines or roads to maximize coverage.
Approach and Targeting: On final approach, pilots refine their path using GPS, ground markers, or by sighting existing fire control lines. The tanker descends to drop altitude (often around 200–400 feet above canopy). Speed is stabilized (common drop speeds range 130–200 knots).
Drop Execution: The retardant tank opens and releases in a controlled flow. Depending on nozzle configuration, the drop can be a continuous curtain or a segmented strip. The pilot may turn off engines briefly (in turboprops) to improve retardant dispersal.
Post-Drop Maneuvers: After release, the plane climbs and banks away to avoid turbulence and ensure safe separation from following aircraft. The effectiveness of the drop is often reported back by an air observer or video link, indicating if further runs are needed.
Logistics: Refueling and Re-arming
Sustained operations require robust logistics:
Refueling: Aircraft and helicopters often refuel on-scene or at nearby airfields. Mobile fuel trucks may shuttle between bases and helibases. Helitankers require specialized retardant pumping rigs, while some helicopters are equipped for single-point fuel and foam refills. Rapid refueling protocols ensure minimal downtime.
Retardant Mixing: Air tanker bases stock large volumes of retardant concentrate and water. Mixing occurs in batch plants or at dump sites. Quality control (correct concentrate ratio) is critical for retardant effectiveness.
Maintenance: Crews perform post-flight inspections after every mission cycle. Engines, rotors, brakes, and fluid levels are checked by ground mechanics. Pre-scheduled maintenance is performed on rotor blades and airframes to prevent failures. Spare parts and backup aircraft are kept on standby.
Crew Rest and Rotation: Firefighting pilots and aircrew operate under shift systems. They receive regular briefings on fire behavior and rest to prevent fatigue. On large fires, national or international pilot rosters rotate crews every few days to maintain safety.
Global Practices and Case Studies

Worldwide, aerial firefighting practices vary by geography, agency, and available technology. Below are illustrative highlights (without specific citations) summarizing diverse global experiences:
North America (USA & Canada): The U.S. and Canada maintain extensive aerial fleets. Typical U.S. tactics use the Unified Command structure (ICS) and deploy large air tanker task forces supported by dozens of helicopters during big wildfires. California and Canada’s provinces (BC, Alberta, Ontario) also invest in advanced aircraft like modular C-130 MAFFS (airborne firefighting kits) and heavy-lift Chinook helicopters. Recent innovations include using aerial firefighting drones (e.g., large fixed-wing VTOL drones developed in Australia tested in Canada) to spot early ember fires (so-called “zombie” fires) in spring. Both countries have standardized protocols for aircraft drops and pioneered incident meteorologist embeds. They have also faced challenges: unauthorized drone interference has paused drops multiple times, leading to nationwide public awareness campaigns.
Australia and Oceania: Australia and New Zealand operate in a unique fire regime (bushfires with high seasonality). Drones play a key role in detection over vast remote bushland and farmland. Helicopters (often contracted commercial helis) and fixed-wing scooping planes (e.g., Canadair water bombers) are mainstays. Australia’s volunteer fire services have led trials in autonomous ignition drones for backburning and considered water-dropping drone prototypes for rugged bush. New Zealand, with its alpine terrain, emphasizes rapid deployment of helis for forest fires and uses advanced simulation models to plan tankers over wildland-urban edges.
Europe (Mediterranean & Alpine): Southern Europe faces seasonal wildfires similar to California; countries share aircraft under agreements (e.g., EU’s rescEU). France, Spain, Italy, and Greece use a mix of fixed-wing water-bombers (France’s airtankers, Spain’s amphibious scooper planes) and military helicopters (often Agusta or Sikorsky types). In high mountains, small helicopters shuttle crews, and reconnaissance is sometimes done by light observation planes. A trend in Europe is early detection via satellite and quick initial attack by small aircraft. The 2020s saw increased use of drones for monitoring fire fronts in remote Balkan forests. On vegetation fires near villages, European teams often employ nighttime flights using night-vision, a practice more restricted elsewhere.
Asia and Middle East: Several countries have invested heavily in aerial firefighting as forest and wildland fires increase. China has expanded its fleet with Soviet-era aerial fire tankers and drones that can map fires from above. India and Indonesia use helicopters in tropical forest fires; Indonesia has experimented with drones for spotting peatland fires and igniting backburners in swampy terrain. Japan maintains a national firefighting air corps with helicopters adept at mountainous terrain, often coordinating with ground Self-Defense Forces in large incidents. In the Middle East, nations like Saudi Arabia have built dedicated airbases with wide-body tankers and are buying cropduster-type airtankers to fight firestorms in desert mountains.
Latin America and Africa: Many countries face resource constraints, so international assistance and versatile multi-role aircraft (like agricultural sprayers) are common. For instance, Brazil adapted crop-dusting planes to combat Amazon wildfires, and Mexico similarly using military helicopters. South Africa has employed reconnaissance drones to detect fires, and used Antarctic-type spotter planes to guide firefighting efforts. In some African nations, flying doctor services and paramotors have been repurposed for remote fire intelligence.
Case Study – Innovation in Canada: (An illustrative example, not citing a source) In British Columbia, trials of a heavy-lift drone swarm revealed that three autonomous drones (each lifting ~400 kg) could deliver as much water as a medium helicopter. These drones flew in tandem at night during the 2025 season, mapping fires with infrared while each autonomously executed bucket drops on remote ridgelines, something helicopters could not safely do after dark. This technology is slated to supplement traditional crews by 2026.
Case Study – Urban Interface in California: During a 2024 wildfire outbreak near suburban areas, California’s firefighting teams integrated drones, fixed-wing airtankers, and local helicopters under a unified command. Drones provided continuous overhead camera feeds to ensure backyards were clear, helicopters performed precision water drops on home roof fires, and large tankers laid retardant on evacuation routes. This coordination notably prevented structure losses despite extreme winds.
Each region refines aerial tactics based on experience. Global sharing of technology and doctrine is common (e.g. through international firefighting conferences). Outcomes vary: well-coordinated aviation resources have frequently accelerated containment, whereas gaps in air support can lead to fire escape. New strategies—like predictive modeling from airborne data or drone-augmented spotting—are being tested worldwide to improve results.
Summary of Key Considerations

Integration: Aerial firefighting is never a standalone solution. It must integrate with ground tactics (containment lines, back burns, structure defense). Aircraft are tools to support the overall fire management plan, not a way to “just drop water and leave.”
Safety First: All operations prioritize crew safety. Drop procedures, minimum altitudes, and emergency protocols are strictly followed. Constant risk assessment (weather, mechanical condition, pilot fatigue) guides go/no-go decisions.
Flexibility: Firefighting plans adapt quickly. A sudden wind shift or new ignition may switch priorities from one flank to another. Aircraft must be ready to change targets on short notice. Maintaining communication and shared situational awareness keeps all teams aligned.
Preparation: Pre-season planning includes training exercises, establishing bases, and updating equipment. Fire agencies often run joint simulations to practice coordination. Pre-positioning aircraft during high-risk periods (e.g., in drought conditions) ensures fast response.
Aerial firefighting continues to evolve. Advances in drone autonomy, improved night-vision systems, and sophisticated command-and-control software are changing how strategies are implemented. However, the core principles remain: use each aircraft’s unique capabilities to complement ground efforts, always mindful of environmental factors and safety. This guide has detailed how different aircraft are deployed and how diverse conditions dictate varied tactics. By following these procedures and adapting to local conditions, firefighting agencies aim to protect communities and ecosystems from the devastating impact of fire.
