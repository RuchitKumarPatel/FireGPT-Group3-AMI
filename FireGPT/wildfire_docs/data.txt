A NASA sensor recently brought a new approach to battling wildfire, providing real-time data that helped firefighters in the field contain a blaze in Alabama. Called AVIRIS-3, which is short for Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer 3, the instrument detected a 120-acre fire on March 19 that had not yet been reported to officials.
As AVIRIS-3 flew aboard a King Air B200 research plane over the fire about 3 miles (5 kilometers) east of Castleberry, Alabama, a scientist on the plane analyzed the data in real time and identified where the blaze was burning most intensely. The information was then sent via satellite internet to fire officials and researchers on the ground, who distributed images showing the fire’s perimeter to firefighters’ phones in the field.
All told, the process from detection during the flyover to alert on handheld devices took a few minutes. In addition to pinpointing the location and extent of the fire, the data showed firefighters its perimeter, helping them gauge whether it was likely to spread and decide where to add personnel and equipment.
“This is very agile science,” said Robert Green, the AVIRIS program’s principal investigator and a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, noting AVIRIS-3 mapped the burn scar left near JPL by the Eaton Fire in January.
Observing the ground from about 9,000 feet (3,000 meters) in altitude, AVIRIS-3 flew aboard several test flights over Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas for a NASA 2025 FireSense Airborne Campaign. Researchers flew in the second half of March to prepare for prescribed burn experiments that took place in the Geneva State Forest in Alabama on March 28 and at Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia from April 14 to 20. During the March span, the AVIRIS-3 team mapped at least 13 wildfires and prescribed burns, as well as dozens of small hot spots (places where heat is especially intense) — all in real time.
Data from imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-3 typically takes days or weeks to be processed into highly detailed, multilayer image products used for research. By simplifying the calibration algorithms, researchers were able to process data on a computer aboard the plane in a fraction of the time it otherwise would have taken. Airborne satellite internet connectivity enabled the images to be distributed almost immediately, while the plane was still in flight, rather than after it landed.
The AVIRIS team generated its first real-time products during a February campaign covering parts of Panama and Costa Rica, and they have continued to improve the process, automating the mapping steps aboard the plane.
‘Fan Favorite’
The AVIRIS-3 sensor belongs to a line of imaging spectrometers built at JPL since 1986. The instruments have been used to study a wide range of phenomena — including fire — by measuring sunlight reflecting from the planet’s surface.
During the March flights, researchers created three types of maps. One, called the Fire Quicklook, combines brightness measurements at three wavelengths of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, to identify the relative intensity of burning. Orange and red areas on the Fire Quicklook map show cooler-burning areas, while yellow indicates the most intense flames. Previously burned areas show up as dark red or brown.
Another map type, the Fire 2400 nm Quicklook, looks solely at infrared light at a wavelength of 2,400 nanometers. The images are particularly useful for seeing hot spots and the perimeters of fires, which show brightly against a red background.
A third type of map, called just Quicklook, shows burned areas and smoke.
The Fire 2400 nm Quicklook was the “fan favorite” among the fire crews, said Ethan Barrett, fire analyst for the Forest Protection Division of the Alabama Forestry Commission. Seeing the outline of a wildfire from above helped Alabama Forestry Commission firefighters determine where to send bulldozers to stop the spread. 
Additionally, FireSense personnel analyzed the AVIRIS-3 imagery to create digitized perimeters of the fires. This provided firefighters fast, comprehensive intelligence of the situation on the ground.
That’s what happened with the Castleberry Fire. Having a clear picture of where it was burning most intensely enabled firefighters to focus on where they could make a difference — on the northeastern edge. 
Then, two days after identifying Castleberry Fire hot spots, the sensor spotted a fire about 4 miles (2.5 kilometers) southwest of Perdido, Alabama. As forestry officials worked to prevent flames from reaching six nearby buildings, they noticed that the fire’s main hot spot was inside the perimeter and contained. With that intelligence, they decided to shift some resources to fires 25 miles (40 kilometers) away near Mount Vernon, Alabama.
To combat one of the Mount Vernon fires, crews used AVIRIS-3 maps to determine where to establish fire breaks beyond the northwestern end of the fire. They ultimately cut the blaze off within about 100 feet (30 meters) of four buildings. 
“Fire moves a lot faster than a bulldozer, so we have to try to get around it before it overtakes us. These maps show us the hot spots,” Barrett said. “When I get out of the truck, I can say, ‘OK, here’s the perimeter.’ That puts me light-years ahead.”
AVIRIS and the Firesense Airborne Campaign are part of NASA’s work to leverage its expertise to combat wildfires using solutions including airborne technologies. The agency also recently demonstrated a prototype from its Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations project that will provide reliable airspace management for drones and other aircraft operating in the air above wildfires.

Wildfires, a natural part of the wildland life cycle, are experiencing a decades-long trend of increased frequency, duration, and magnitude, resulting in increased risk of fatalities and property damage. Fire suppression methods are adapting accordingly, including the increased use of aerial firefighting. Aerial firefighting, conducted in coordination with ground crews, provides real-time reconnaissance of a wildfire and performs strategic drops of retardant to contain and/or suppress the fire. These flight operations require airport and air traffic control infrastructure. The purpose of this report is to provide statistics on the U.S. aerial firefighting fleet, flight operations, and airport utilization and equipment in 2024. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers. Thirty-four (34) Very Large/Large Air Tankers (VLAT/LATs) were under contract with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) in 2024. The aircraft, ranging in age from 27 to 57 years, performed 11,219 retardant drop and reposition flights. Flights operated on 88% of the days with an average of 35 flights per day and a maximum of 200 flights per day. The number of flights per aircraft across the fleet was not uniform (average 288 flights, max 465 flights). Consistent with firefighting practices, the flights operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), mostly in the afternoons, with an average retardant drop flight duration of 34 min. Two hundred and seven (207) airports supported at least one departure, with 14 airports supporting 50% of the departures. Eighty-six (86%) percent of the airports were towered and 84% had precision approach procedures. All but two military airports were public airports that are part of the National Plan for Integrated Airport System (NPIAS) and eligible for Airport Improvement Plan (AIP) funding. Runway length and weight bearing are limitations at several airports. Furthermore, operations are no longer limited to airports west of the Rockies, with increased operations in the mid-west and east coast.
Wildfires are a natural and essential part of the wildland life cycle and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and promoting biodiversity. Wildfires in the United States, however, have become more frequent due to prolonged droughts [1] and the expanded human development in fire-prone regions [2]. Over the past several decades, rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns have intensified fire conditions, leading to extended fire seasons that now last several months longer than in previous decades [3]. The number of large wildfires, particularly megafires exceeding 100,000 acres, has increased since the early 2000s [4].
In response to these trends, wildfire management has evolved through technological advancements and strategic policy changes. For example, remote sensing and satellite imagery now play a crucial role in monitoring fire-prone areas [5], and artificial intelligence and predictive modeling have been integrated into fire forecasting [6].
Aerial firefighting has also undergone significant advancements to support ground crew operations with wildfire containment suppression efforts. Helicopters are equipped with precision water-dropping systems and infrared cameras to provide real-time situational awareness, enabling better coordination with ground crews [7]. Night-flying aircraft and drones have also been introduced to conduct suppression efforts around the clock, helping to contain fires in their early stages when visibility is typically reduced for traditional firefighting operations [8].
Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs) and Large Air Tankers (LATs) increasingly play a critical role in the initial attack, establishing containment lines, and suppression [9,10,11]. With their range and speed, VLATs and LATs provide rapid response to wildfires in remote locations and/or rugged terrain. VLATs, such as DC-10s, carry up to 10,000 gallons of retardant and drop approximately a one-mile containment line (depending on conditions). LATs, such as MD-87, 737, BAE 146, and C-130 s, carry between 3000 and 4000 gallons of retardant, and drop a 1/3 mile containment line.
VLAT and LAT operations are supported by a network of airports, designated as air tanker bases, that have the necessary infrastructure to support these operations [12].
This paper provides statistics on VLAT and LAT aerial firefighting operations and the demands on airports in the U.S. in 2024. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers.

3. Results
In 2024, there were 887 air tanker mobilizations [13]. This is the median mobilization account over the last 10 years. A detailed analysis of fleet characteristics, flight operations, airport operations, and airport characteristics was conducted in 2024.
3.1. Fleet Characteristics
The 2024 the MATOC fleet was composed of 34 aircraft (Table 2). There were 16 BAE–146 class vehicles with a retardant capacity of 3000 gallons, 14 vehicles with a 4000-gallon capacity (737, DC-9, and C-130), and 4 DC-10s’ that had a retardant capacity of 9400 gallons. The C-130s load retardant via pre-filled roll-on tanks to reduce retardant loading times. The other vehicles load retardant through flow (i.e., batch loading pumps or gravity feed).
The fleet is an aging fleet (Figure 2). The oldest aircraft, the C-130s, are 57 years old since the date of manufacture. The newest aircraft, RJ85A, is 25 years old since the date of manufacture. The number of aircraft is equally split above and below the mean age of 33.5 years and a median age of 34 years.
3.2. Flight Operations
Analysis of flight operations was conducted for 2024.
3.2.1. Overall Flight Operations
An estimated total of 11,219 flights were conducted during this period. Twelve percent (12%) percent of the days during this period did not have flights. These days include days when there were no active wildfires, or days with an active wildfire, but VLATS/LATS were not dispatched. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the days had at least one VLAT/LAT flight.
3.2.2. Flights per Day
Of the days in which the VLATS/LATS were active (Figure 3), the maximum number of flights per day was 200 (26 July 2024, Camp Fire). The median number of flights per day was 22 with an average of 43 flights per day. The standard deviation was 43 flights per day. There were 21 days in which the number of flights exceeded 2σ (121 flights per day) and 11 days in which the number of flights exceeded 3σ (11 flights per day).
Ranked flights per day exhibit a power curve distribution. Thirty-one (31) percent of the days had more than 50 VLAT/LAT flights. Fourteen (14) percent of the days had more than 100 flights.
Retardant drop flights occurred on every day in which the VLATS/LATS were active. On one day, across the fleet, there were as many as 157 retardant drop flights. The average number of retardant drop flights per day is 22, with a median of 8. On 45% percent of the days when the VLATS/LATS were active, there were less than five retardant drop flights per day.
Repositioning flights occurred on every day in which the VLATS/LATS were active. On one day, across the fleet, there were as many as 63 repositioning flights. The average number of repositioning flights per day is 10, with a median of 5. Note repositioning flights includes flights for maintenance purposes.
3.2.3. Flights by Tail Number
The number of flights by tail number ranged from 465 to 1. The average number of flights by tail number was 288 in total, with a median of 319 flights (Figure 4). The distribution of flights by tail number is asymmetric with a slight left tail. Fifty-eight (58) percent of the tail numbers operated more than the median number of flights during the period.
3.2.4. Flight Departure Time of Day
Consistent with aerial firefighting practices, VLAT/LAT flights operate under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The VLAT/LAT flights departed predominantly during daylight hours (Figure 5). The majority of both retardant drop and repositioning flights (>60%) departed after noon local time.
3.2.5. Flight Duration
Retardant drop flights exhibited wheels-off to wheels-on times with a mean of 38 min (estimated 220 miles) and median of 34 min (estimated 200 miles) roundtrip (Figure 6). These times include transit to the drop zone, loiter, drop, and then transit from the drop zone to the base.
3.2.6. Ramp Turn-Around Time for Retardant Drop Flights
Ramp turn-around time for retardant drop flights is measured from wheels-on to wheels-off for sequential retardant drop flights on the same day. This includes time at the retardant pit as well as time to and from the pit including departure queueing and ramp congestion. The estimated retardant loading time is 30–45 min for the DC-10 and 20–30 min for the 737, DC-9, and Avro 146. These times are reflected in the ramp turn-around time distribution: mean 36 min, median 25 min. Ten (10) percent of the flights exceeded 40 min turn-around time which may be the result of dispatch instructions as well as ramp congestion and departure queueing delays.
3.3. Airport Operations
The MATOC 2024 fleet departed from 207 airports (Figure 7). One-hundred and five (105) airports have five or more departures. Fifty (50) airports supported 90% of the departures. Fourteen (14) airports supported 50% of the departures (Table 3).
Two airports used are military airports: Fort Huachuca/Sierra Vista, Arizona (Army) and Hill Air Force Base—Ogden Utah. The remaining airports are all publicly owned and part of the National Plan for Integrated Airports (NPIAS).
Eighty-four (84) percent of the airports used had two or more runways.
For the longest runway at each airport, the median runway length is 9000′ and the mean is 9127′ (Figure 8). The shortest length of the longest runway is 5060′ (KPTV—Porterville, California) with the longest 13,503′ (KMWH—Grant County Intl Moses Lake, WA, USA).
The lowest airport elevation is sea level 46′ (KCRP—Corpus Christi, Texas), and the highest elevation is 6187′ (KCOS—Colorado Springs, Colorado). The mean and median elevation is 2872′.
The distribution of runway weight bearing for dual-tandem landing gears of VLATS and LATS has a median of 270,000 lbs and a mean of 372,000 lbs. To support VLATS and LATS operations, many airports provide a waiver. Thirty-six (36) percent of the airports used by VLATS and LATS in the 2024 fire season did not have a Pavement Classification Number (PCN) classification. The median PCN is 60 with a mean PCN of 53. The PCN is another way of assessing the weight-bearing capacity of airport runways. PCN is a standardized method to quantify the structural strength of an airport’s runway, taxiway, or other pavements, ensuring that aircraft operate safely without compromising infrastructure integrity.
Eighty-six (86) percent of the airports used by VLATS and LATS in the 2024 fire season had a control tower. Many of the most used airports were non-towered: KCOE (Coeur d’Alene, Idaho), KINW (Winslow, Arizona), KLGD (La Grande, Oregon)—3.6% of flights, KPTV (Porterville, California), KPRB (Paso Robles, California), and KMYL (McCall, Idaho).
Airports supporting VLATS and LATS operations in the 2024 fire season all supported precision approach procedures: RNAV (GPS)—89%, ILS—83%, VOR, VOR-DME, VORTAC—80%, RNAV (RNP)—44%, GPS—6%, and Published Visual—4%.
4. Discussion
The section discusses the implications of the above statistical findings.
4.1. Fleet Age and Part Obsolescence
The existing VLAT/LAT fleet is an aged fleet (mean 33 years, max 57 years). As the aircraft age, part obsolescence is a growing problem resulting in increased maintenance costs.
Unlike commercial airliners, which benefit from large-scale manufacturing, the niche market for specifically designed aerial firefighting aircraft makes it difficult to achieve economies of scale, leading to high per-unit costs [14]. Barring government subsidies or changes in the economics of aerial firefighting, a clean-sheet design of VLAT/LAT is unlikely. Due to these economics, the industry is obliged to rely on converting the existing commercial and military aircraft rather than investing in purpose-built designs.
One of the ways to address this issue is to enable the sale of the Department of Defense’s excess aircraft for aerial firefighting purposes (e.g., the U.S. Congress has a bill pending -the Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act of 2025).
4.2. Fleet Size and Availability
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires have raised concerns about the size of the fleet to meet operational wildfire demands [15]. For example, in 2024, the National Interagency Coordination Center Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics Annual Report [11] identified that 16% of air tanker mobilization requests were “Unable to Fulfill (UTF)”. Although the request process is complex and there are many reasons for UTF, the statistics suggest a shortfall even though the 2024 fire season was relatively low.
The primary factor determining the privately owner VLAT/LAT fleet size in the U.S. is the government contracting mechanism. The U.S. Forest Service employs two primary contracting mechanisms to manage its fleet of Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs) and Large Air Tankers (LATs): Exclusive-Use (EU) contracts and Call-When-Needed (CWN) contracts [13].
EU contracts provide guaranteed availability of aircraft for a specified period, ensuring that tankers are readily accessible during peak wildfire seasons. In contrast, CWN contracts allow the agency to request aircraft on an as-needed basis (if they are available).
While CWN contracts offer flexibility and cost savings to the government during periods of low fire activity, they present challenges with regard to fleet expansion and readiness. CWN contracts shift the financial risk to private service providers who must maintain readiness without assured deployment. Service providers under CWN agreements may face financial uncertainties due to the lack of guaranteed income, potentially leading to reduced investment in aircraft maintenance or acquisition. This situation can also result in the limited availability of air tankers when demand surges. For instance, in 2021, the Forest Service aimed to activate 16 CWN air tankers but could only secure five. The other tankers were contracted out overseas [16].
Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission [2] has called for an evaluation of alternate VLAT/LAT ownership models: government vs. private-owned aviation assets. Furthermore, the commission called for developing a strategic framework and national performance measures in order to determine the appropriate or optimal number of aircraft.
Another option is to pool resources among countries [17]. A fleet could be managed by an appropriate United Nations office and funded by international contributions. In the event of any wildfire emergency, a subscribing member nation would have optional recourse to this fleet operated in coordination with their own national/state fire agencies.
4.3. Flight Operations
Daylight operations are consistent with wildfire fighting protocols and the nature of VLAT/LAT retardant drops. Retardant drops require VLATs and LATs to fly at low altitudes, often in rugged terrain, under the guidance of spotter aircraft. These precise maneuvers require maintaining visual contact with the ground and surrounding area and would naturally require Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Also, fires generally behave differently at night due to lower temperatures, potentially making large-scale drops less necessary compared to the intense fire behavior seen during the day.
4.4. Airport Operations and Characteristics
Airports that are used are determined by their proximity to the wildfires and their available capabilities. Particularly, west of the Rocky Mountains, airports with appropriate capabilities are within range of the location of the fires. However, there are questions about the geographic proximity and airport capabilities in other regions of the country. Notably, in 2024, there were airports used east of the Rocky Mountains that have traditionally not supported aerial fire-fighting operations: Maine, Louisiana, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
4.5. Runway Length, Temperature and Retardant Capacity
The relationship between runway length, temperature, and density altitude is particularly important for aircraft departing at or close to maximum takeoff weight. Aircraft rely on the density of the air to generate lift and thrust. At higher elevations, the air density decreases, so at high elevations, the engines produce less thrust, and the wings generate less lift. The result is that aircraft need more runway length to achieve the necessary speed for takeoff or landing in thinner air because they require a longer distance to generate enough lift. A general rule of thumb is that for every 1000 feet of elevation above sea level, an airport generally requires about 5% to 10% more runway length to account for the reduced air density. Temperature is also a factor. Warmer air is also less dense than cooler air, so high temperatures (especially in summer) can have a similar effect to high altitude, requiring longer runways.
Runway length at airports at higher elevations during the summer months has been identified as an issue for the VLATS/LATS. In 2024, an estimated 5% of the flights at higher elevations airports were dispatched with up to 20% less retardant to account for temperature, elevation, and runway length.
For the top airports supporting aerial fire-fighting operations, the higher-elevation airports did not necessarily have the longest runways (Figure 9). In fact, several of the most used airports at higher elevations were the airports that experienced “downloading”: Winslow (KINW), Prescott (KPRC), Silver City (KSCV), Rimona (KRNM), Porterville (KPTV), and McCall (KMYL).
4.6. Runway Weight Bearing
For air tankers, runway weight bearing is important as these aircraft carry significant weight when loaded with large amounts of retardant. Runways must be designed to handle these heavy loads to prevent runway damage, ensure safe takeoffs and landings, and maintain the overall safety and performance of the air tanker operations. Continuous high-frequency operations may lead to structural degradation. Many airports operated under waivers regarding weight-bearing capacity.
4.7. Airport Navigation Aides
Navigation aids for precision approaches are useful for VLAT/LAT operations. Although flights predominantly operate under VMC, there are scenarios in which the drop zone is VMS but the airport may experience reduced visibility due to smoke or low ceilings.
4.8. Ramp Congestion
Increased cargo and general aviation operations at air tanker airports have contributed to ramp congestion, which impacts turnaround times and operational efficiency.
4.9. Retardant Safety
Modern fire retardants are designed to be highly effective in wildfire suppression. The primary active ingredient in long-term fire retardants is ammonium phosphate, a compound widely used in agriculture. Once applied, fire retardant remains effective until it is removed by significant rainfall, at which point it breaks down and can act as a fertilizer for vegetation. To minimize any potential environmental impact, application guidelines include designated avoidance areas near waterways and sensitive habitats.
Fire retardants approved by the USFS do not contain intentionally added pre- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or other persistent chemicals, and the red color commonly seen in aerial drops comes from a fugitive dye that fades over time with UV exposure. This color helps ensure precise application, reducing redundant drops and improving efficiency.
4.10. Retardant Availability
A critical issue is ensuring that fire retardants are available at the right place and time to support aerial firefighting operations. An intricate supply chain infrastructure plays a vital role in the overall success of wildfire containment strategies The logistical complexity of this effort requires a strategic, multi-layered infrastructure to adapt to rapidly evolving fire conditions. To meet the demand, a network of multiple manufacturing and distribution centers are located across the U.S.
The logistical challenges of wildfire response require real-time coordination between manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and frontline firefighting operations. Due to the unpredictability of wildfires, fire retardants cannot be stockpiled indiscriminately but must be strategically positioned for rapid deployment. Logistics teams must work around the clock to navigate transportation constraints, fluctuating fire behavior, and limited trucking capacity, ensuring that supplies reach critical locations without delay.
4.11. Water Availability for Retardant Loading
The availability of high-volume water sources was identified as a critical factor for efficient turnaround. Remote ramp space with easy access to water stands will be vital for sustaining LAT/VLAT operations in the future.
5. Conclusions
Wildfires are a key ecological process that maintains biodiversity and promotes ecological health in fire-prone regions. Nevertheless, when uncontrolled, wildfires can rapidly escalate, creating severe threats to ecosystems, human life, and infrastructure. The increasing frequency and intensity of these fires have led to a greater need for effective fire suppression strategies.
Over the past several decades, aerial firefighting has become an essential component of wildfire response, providing real-time reconnaissance and delivering strategic drops of fire retardant to suppress flames and protect threatened areas. However, these operations rely heavily on airport infrastructure and air traffic management systems to ensure efficient and safe deployment of firefighting resources.
This report provides a statistical analysis of the Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) and Large Air Tanker (LAT) fleets contracted under the USFS MATOC program for the 2024 fire season. Data include the number of aircraft, flight operations, and airport utilization, and key performance metrics such as aircraft age, operational tempo, and the impact of runway specifications on firefighting efficacy. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers.
The statistical results are dependent on the availability and accuracy of the data. Where possible, the data and results were verified by secondary sources and by subject matter experts.

Aerial Firefighting: Technologies, Strategies, and Operational Procedures

Aerial firefighting combines aircraft and advanced technologies to support ground crews in detecting, monitoring, and suppressing fires. This guide covers platforms like fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), describing how each is deployed across different fire scenarios. It examines tactical approaches for wildland, grassland, urban-interface, and industrial fires, and explains detailed procedures for aerial drops, crew transport, and logistics. We also explore how weather, terrain, and visibility shape decisions in the air and on the ground. Each section is structured with clear headings and concise paragraphs, plus ordered or bullet lists for key steps and considerations, to form an in-depth operational guide.
Fire Types and Tactical Approaches

Different fire environments demand tailored aerial strategies. Key fire categories include wildfires, grassland (prairie) fires, urban-interface fires, and industrial or structure fires. The type of fuel, terrain, and proximity to people or facilities affect the choice of aircraft, suppression agents, and mission tactics. Aerial resources may focus on slowing the fire’s spread, targeting hotspots, or protecting assets depending on the context.
Wildland/Wildfires
Environment: Wildfires burn forests, brush, and other natural vegetation. They often occur in remote or rugged terrain and can spread quickly under hot, dry, and windy conditions.
Objectives: The aerial goal is usually to contain the fire perimeter and reinforce control lines until ground crews secure the fire. Early detection and mapping allow quick response before a small ignition grows.
Tactics: Aircraft perform indirect attacks by dropping water or retardant along ridgelines and access routes to slow advancement. Successive drops create firebreak corridors that help ground teams cut lines. Aerial observation guides where to deploy resources and can identify spot fires or flare-ups beyond the main front.
Coordination: Aerial tactics support large-scale incident operations. Air Attack or Air Tactical Supervisors manage multiple planes and helicopters. Spotter planes or airborne command units relay targets and adjust tactics in real time. Helicopters may deploy helitack crews (firefighters transported by helicopter) to construct line directly in tough spots.
Example Approaches: Common practices include running parallel retardant lines on flank of a fire (often along ridges or roads) and using helicopters to reconnoiter fire edge and lift water for precise drops on fiery hotspots. During extended incidents, fixed-wing airtankers may establish continuous shuttle-dropping operations from remote tanker bases.
Grassland and Prairie Fires
Environment: Grassland fires burn fine, dry grasses and light shrubs. They move very fast across open plains but typically burn out quickly.
Objectives: Suppression aims to quickly extinguish or control the spread before large areas are lost. Resources can often be concentrated in lines or backfire operations because of generally flatter terrain.
Tactics: Single-engine airtankers (SEATs) and helicopters make low-altitude runs to knock down fire edges. Because grass burns rapidly, multiple aircraft may work in tandem, creating parallel attack lines to encircle the fire. Aerial ignitions (using drip torches) can also set controlled burns to deprive the main fire of fuel.
Coordination: Fire spread is extremely weather-driven (especially wind). Pilots focus on attacking the active head of the fire while ground crews contain flanks. Medium or large fixed-wing tankers are less common unless the fire grows, so initial aerial response often relies on lighter aircraft that can turn quickly.
Example Approaches: In grassland fires, aircraft often execute frequent, shallow-water drops in quick succession. If wind shifts threaten communities, helicopters may dip in small lakes or haul portable pumps to deliver water directly on structures at the fire’s edge.
Urban-Wildland Interface Fires
Environment: Interface fires occur where wildlands meet built-up areas (homes, businesses, infrastructure). Fuels include vegetation near structures, fences, decks, and sometimes storage tanks. Wind patterns can be complex due to buildings and landscape features.
Objectives: Priority is protecting life and property. Aircraft work to establish defensible space around structures, cool burning buildings, and slow fire encroachment into neighborhoods.
Tactics: Precision matters. Helicopters may deliver water or foam directly onto structure hotspots or roof areas. Fixed-wing aircraft can lay retardant lines around neighborhoods or ahead of the fire line. Drones and forward scouts identify fires encroaching on homes or any new ignition points quickly.
Coordination: Operations are usually closely integrated with local fire departments. Aircrews must avoid populated areas when dropping to prevent flying debris and ensure all civilians are evacuated from drop zones. Communication is critical: aircraft relay which structures are threatened and where ground crews should concentrate.
Example Approaches: Pre-deployment of skimmers or local tankers is common when a fire threatens an interface community. Urban firefighting drones equipped with thermal cameras may scan behind barriers or within school perimeters. If industrial or high-risk facilities (like chemical plants or oil fields) lie near wildland, specialized foam or retardant may be used to cool equipment and fuel sources.
Industrial and Structure Fires
Environment: Fires in industrial sites, chemical plants, refineries, or large buildings involve flammable liquids, gases, or hazardous materials. These fires can erupt in complex facility layouts.
Objectives: The immediate priority is preventing catastrophic explosions, containing hazardous runoff, and protecting human life. Aerial assets provide support for overall cooling and indirect control.
Tactics: Often, the aerial role is supportive rather than primary. Helicopters may drop foam to blanket burning pools or large tanks (though ground monitors usually handle most of the firefighting). Smokejumper and helitack helicopters can insert fire crews onto rooftops or tight industrial zones inaccessible by land. Fixed-wing tankers might drop water to cool debris or nearby fuel stores, but this requires careful coordination to avoid spreading contaminants.
Coordination: Multi-agency coordination is crucial. Local emergency services usually lead, and aerial operations integrate under an Incident Command System (ICS) structure. Safety corridors are established for aircraft to approach targets. Specialized teams may treat discharged water (which can be toxic) and monitor air for chemical exposure.
Example Approaches: If a chemical plant fire threatens to reach storage tanks, helicopters may perform targeted foam drops on the worst areas. Drones fitted with gas sensors or cameras can survey for leaking pipelines. In some cases, military or industrial firefighting planes loaded with foam concentrate have been used to blanket large-scale petrochemical fires.
Aerial Platforms and Technologies

Modern aerial firefighting employs a range of aircraft and support systems. Each platform has strengths and limitations. This section examines operational aspects of drones (UAVs), helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and emerging technologies (airships, high-altitude platforms) in firefighting roles.
Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
Drones have become essential tools in firefighting, primarily for intelligence gathering, early detection, and situational awareness. Most firefighting drones carry cameras, sensors, or communications gear rather than water. Key points include:
Detection and Surveillance: Fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones equipped with optical and infrared (IR) cameras scan large areas for smoke or thermal hotspots. They can launch quickly from staging areas to locate new fires or spot flare-ups beyond accessible roads. For example, specialized drones can execute automated flight paths over forests at dawn to detect lightning-caused ignitions when aircrews are limited by darkness or fog.
Real-Time Monitoring: Drones relay live video and heat maps to incident command. They hover or circle over a fire front to gauge intensity and movement. This real-time data supplements satellite or manned-aircraft imagery, especially in poor visibility. Operators often fly drones to relay communications or act as aerial platforms for mobile networks (cellular or radio repeaters) at remote fires.
Precision Support: Smaller drones can be directed to specific tasks, such as mapping a fire perimeter or verifying containment lines. Thermal drones can search embers at night, guiding firefighters to hot spots. Emerging drone swarms (groups of cooperating UAVs) use AI to distribute the workload: some drones illuminate the fire (IR scanning), others map terrain in 3D, and a central command drone synthesizes the data. High-altitude pseudo-satellites or long-endurance planes can serve as command hubs directing these smaller UAVs.
Suppression Applications: Most drones lack capacity to drop much water or retardant (payloads are usually under 10–100 liters for small drones). However, heavy-lift UAVs under development can carry hundreds of kilograms. For instance, multi-rotor drones with 400 kg capacity are being tested to carry water buckets or foam by air. Concepts include autonomous drones that fly through the night to mop up remnant flames when manned aircraft must ground. Additionally, specialized drone models can shoot fire-retardant pellets or use compressed gas to create local firebreaks, although these techniques are still experimental.
Swarming and AI: Cutting-edge programs aim to coordinate fleets of drones for continuous coverage. AI onboard can segment smoke and fire from background in real time, prioritize targets, and even predict fire spread. Data fusion from multiple sensors (visual, IR, multispectral, LIDAR) improves situational awareness. All this happens with minimal human input, potentially letting drones autonomously patrol fire-prone regions and raise the alarm.
Limitations: Drones face constraints: battery life (unless tethered or solar-powered), vulnerability to heat/smoke, and regulatory hurdles (airspace permits, BVLOS rules). Smoke and ash can obscure camera views. Helicopter downwash or electromagnetic interference can disrupt drone signals. Safety protocols often require drones to stand down if manned aircraft are nearby. Unauthorized drones by hobbyists have even forced grounding of active firefighting planes. Managing civilian drone activity is now a major coordination task.
Helicopters
Helicopters are agile rotary-wing aircraft widely used in firefighting for water and retardant drops, crew transport, reconnaissance, and logistical support. They excel at operating in rugged terrain and at low altitudes. Key features include:
Water and Retardant Drops: Many helicopters carry an external bucket (commonly a Bambi Bucket) or an internal belly tank. A bucket is lowered on a cable and filled by hovering over a water source (lake, river, pond, or portable pool). Water is then dropped in a targeted plunge. Belly tanks allow faster refills (no dipping required) but add permanent weight. Helicopter pilots make precise, vertical drops or fan-pattern drops on intense hotspots. Helicopters are often used for “mop-up” tasks: following larger air attacks to extinguish smoldering areas.
Crew and Cargo Transport: Helicopters deploy helitack crews—teams of wildland firefighters—to hard-to-reach locations. Personnel may rappel or fast-rope to the ground from hovering helicopters. Helicopters also lift tools, fuel, chain saws, supplies, and portable pumps into the fire zone. Sling-load missions carry big equipment or even vehicles to forward bases. Emergency medevac (short-haul) operations can extract injured firefighters or civilians by winch or long-line, sometimes under fire conditions.
Types of Helicopters: Models vary from small scout helicopters (e.g. 4-seat light helicopters) to heavy-lift rotorcraft. Common firefighting types include: tandem-rotor helitankers (e.g. Sikorsky S-64 AirCrane) that can carry over 3,700 liters of water; medium helicopters (e.g. Bell 205/212, UH-1 variants, 2,300-liter capacity) often used for backup drops and crew moves; and smaller helicopters (e.g. MD 500, Kamov) for reconnaissance or urban use. The choice depends on mission: large helitankers require prepared helispots, smaller ones can land almost anywhere.
Drop Techniques: Helicopters approach drop sites much slower and lower than fixed-wing aircraft. A typical process is:
Fill: Hover over water or line up with a dip-source, fill bucket/tank.
Transit: Fly to target, often under 100 knots.
Aim: Pilot aligns on the drop point, sometimes using laser or visual cues.
Release: Open the bucket’s valve or pump out water, usually at a low altitude for accuracy.
Safety Checks: Observers or spotters may stand by to confirm drop accuracy and that the bucket is clear of obstacles.
Advantages: Helicopters can hover, loiter, and turn in place. They can operate in valleys and near buildings. They do not need runways and can refuel at small helibases. Some helicopters scoop water automatically from rivers on the fly. Helicopters can also drop foam and other fire suppressants if fitted with tanks and pumps.
Challenges: Helicopter operations are heavily impacted by smoke and updrafts. Rotorcraft create strong downwash, which can stir up burning debris. Pilots must constantly adjust for wind gusts and thermals over fire. Night operations are limited (few agencies fly helicopters at night on wildfires due to darkness and smoke). Pilot fatigue and crew rotation are major concerns. Maintenance is intensive due to high operational tempo in dusty/smoky conditions.
Logistics Support: On multi-day incidents, helibases are established near the fire. They serve as hubs for fueling, maintenance, and crew briefing. Spare buckets, hoses, spare parts, and fuel trucks are essential. Crews also coordinate with air tanker base operations to share weather info and avoid conflicts.
Emerging Rotary Technologies: Autonomous flight systems are being tested in large helicopters. For example, experimental programs have equipped attack helicopters with onboard mission computers that can execute guided water drops with minimal pilot input. Some new eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) concepts are aimed at high-rise firefighting or urban supply runs. However, mainstream helicopter technology still relies on skilled pilots and established airframe designs.
Fixed-Wing Aircraft
Fixed-wing aircraft provide rapid, long-range response and deliver large volumes of water or retardant. Their higher speed and altitude capabilities complement helicopters. Main categories include:
Single-Engine Air Tankers (SEATs): Typically converted agricultural planes (e.g. Air Tractor AT-802) carrying 800–3,000 liters. Agile and able to operate from short, unimproved runways close to the fire. Used extensively for initial attack on small fires or to flank larger fires. SEATs drop water or foam to knock down flames until larger assets arrive.
Large Air Tankers (LATs): Multi-engine turboprops or jets modified for fire retardant (e.g. P2V Neptune, CL-215 series). Capacities range from 3,000 to 13,000 liters. They drop thicker retardant lines to slow fires in vegetation. Due to size, LATs operate from major airbases with runways. They provide end-to-end coverage: travel to fires hundreds of kilometers away, drop, then return for reload.
Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs): Converted airliners (e.g. DC-10, L-1011, or 747) and military transports (C-130). They can drop tens of thousands of liters of retardant or fire-fighting foam in one pass. VLATs usually handle the most critical sectors of very large wildfires. Many VLATs carry modular drop systems, allowing them to be refilled with retardant in minutes.
Retardant and Water Tanks: Fixed-wing aircraft typically use retardant (a colored slurry of water, fertilizer, and additives) on wildfires. Retardant forms a fire-retarding barrier on the ground. Some tanker aircraft also carry water or fire-retardant foam for very hot spots. Tank capacity and discharge mechanism vary by aircraft, but pilots compute release speed, altitude, and distance based on aircraft type and wind conditions.
Drop Runs: An attack run by a fixed-wing tanker is a planned sequence:
Pre-Flight: Mission briefing includes target location (often marked by GPS coordinates) and safe flight line.
Engagement: The tanker lines up perpendicular or at a calculated angle to the fire line to achieve desired drop shape (straight line, “skunk stripe,” or V-shaped pattern).
Drop: The pilot releases retardant at a predetermined point, usually flying 250–500 feet above ground for fixed wings. The aircraft’s speed and the wind determine how the retardant tracks and lands.
Exit: After release, the plane climbs away and is monitored until safe. Spotter aircraft often follow larger tankers to confirm drop accuracy.
Crew Transport: Fixed-wing planes generally do not carry firefighters to the scene (with few exceptions like military smokejumpers or Air Force pararescue). Instead, their role is dropping material. However, multi-mission aircraft can transport light cargo or serve as communication relays.
Advantages: Fast redeployment over long distances. Continuous dropping from VLATs can saturate large fire lines faster than helicopters. Fixed-wing planes burn more fuel but can carry much heavier loads per trip. Many are equipped with weather radars to navigate smoke and avoid storms.
Challenges: Require suitable runways for launch and landing. Heavily smoke-shrouded valleys can obscure targets, so drop accuracy may suffer. Fixed-wings have minimum drop altitudes (typically a few hundred feet) to allow safety margins, limiting precision in confined terrain. They also need well-coordinated radio communication with ground/air supervisors to avoid collisions.
Logistics: Major fires often mobilize national or international tanker fleets. Tanker bases must have fuel, retardant mixing facilities, and loading crews. Many countries maintain permanent “air tanker bases” in fire-prone regions or temporary tanker staging areas.
Other Aerial Technologies
Beyond traditional aircraft, several emerging or specialized technologies support firefighting:
Airships and Aerostats: Blimps or tethered balloons equipped with high-resolution sensors can hover over fires for prolonged observation. They offer stable platforms for infrared scanners and communications equipment. While they cannot drop water, they can provide real-time surveillance in areas where drones are impractical or at night when UAV operations are restricted.
High-Altitude Platforms: Long-endurance unmanned airplanes or balloons (like pseudo-satellites) can carry wide-area cameras or LiDAR to detect fires under cloud cover or before they spread. These do not typically interact directly with a fire but improve detection and forecasting.
Satellite Remote Sensing: Geostationary and polar-orbit satellites detect fires and smoke plumes at very large scale (hundreds of kilometers), useful for strategic planning. Fire satellites feed data to incident teams, but their resolution is coarse for tactical use.
Autonomous Aircraft: Some new concepts involve fully autonomous or remotely piloted craft performing drops. For example, modified jet transports under remote control have been demonstrated for retardant drops. Small autonomous fixed-wing drones could potentially drop micro-retardant spheres for fine control on small hot spots in future.
Technical Aids: Aircraft are increasingly equipped with on-board sensors like infrared mapping cameras, atmospheric sensors (air temperature, humidity, wind speed), GPS-guidance for retardant drops, and communications gear. Advances in datalink technology allow live video streaming from any aircraft to ground command centers. Night vision goggles and thermal imaging are now used in some air crews to continue operations after dark or through smoke.
Non-Drop Applications: Aircraft have also been used to sow firebreaks (e.g. arcing fire-starting pyrotechnics) or to deliver tools (like portable pumps or generators) via parachute. In some regions, flying lightning-seeding generators (silver iodide) have been tested to trigger precipitation.
Weather and Environmental Factors

Weather and local atmospheric conditions critically influence aerial firefighting strategy and safety. Pilots and incident planners constantly assess wind, temperature, humidity, and precipitation when making decisions. Key considerations include:
Wind: Perhaps the most influential factor. Wind speed and direction determine fire spread rate and direction. Strong winds can ground aircraft due to turbulence limits. Sudden gusts or downdrafts near ridges can violently shake or overturn helicopters. Wind also deflects water or retardant drops: pilots must adjust drop points upwind of target. When planning drops, crews account for wind drift by measuring it (using wind kits or observing smoke) and adjusting aim. High-altitude jet streams can shear large drops apart, so heavy winds aloft can reduce drop coherence.
Temperature: Hot daytime temperatures lower air density, reducing aircraft lift and engine performance. This limits maximum payload on takeoff (especially for helicopters at high altitudes). Heat also intensifies fires: large fires create convection columns, and ambient heat can make fires unpredictable. Pilots check density altitude charts: on a hot summer day at elevation, a helicopter may be unable to lift its bucket fully. Fuel planning may require offloading or fueling en route to compensate for reduced climb performance.
Humidity: Dry air (low humidity) allows fires to ignite and spread more rapidly because vegetation moisture is low. As humidity falls (especially below about 20-30%), the fire danger increases sharply. In very low humidity, even moderate winds can cause extreme fire behavior. Aircraft crews monitor humidity to predict fire “runs” (sudden growth). Conversely, higher humidity dampens fuels and slows fire spread, allowing safer and more effective drops. Humidity also affects fire retardant effectiveness; retardant formulas may need adjusting for very dry or very moist fuel conditions.
Precipitation and Storms: Rain is generally beneficial for firefighting, sometimes allowing a temporary halt in operations (since aircraft may not fly in heavy rain, or to let ground crews catch their breath). However, approaching thunderstorms pose dangers: lightning can start new fires, and downdrafts can destabilize low-flying aircraft. Even light rain can cause visibility issues or wet gear (though modern aircraft can fly in drizzle). Pilots avoid flying near storm cells or low clouds. In some cases, cloud-seeding from aircraft has been tested to induce rainfall, but this is rare operationally.
Smoke and Visibility: Thick smoke plumes severely reduce pilot visibility and obscure terrain. Smoke also carries particulate matter that can scratch windscreens and foul engines. Pilots often fly at night or twilight using infrared cameras to “see” through smoke, but many agencies restrict flights to daytime for safety. Smoke inversion layers can trap haze near the ground; helicopters operating in or under an inversion must fly without seeing the ground, which is hazardous. Teams use pre-flight briefings to mark smoke layers, and some modern aircraft have synthetic vision systems (SVS) or terrain awareness warning systems (TAWS) to prevent controlled flight into terrain.
Topography-Induced Weather: Mountainous and complex terrain creates localized weather conditions. For example, valleys can channel winds (like a funnel), increasing speed, while ridges create wind shear. Slope and elevation cause upslope winds by day and downslope cool winds at night. Sun-heated slopes produce strong updrafts (fire thermals), whereas shaded canyons may hold dense smoke. Pilots must consider that a flight through a mountain pass in the morning may encounter clear air, but by midday a buildup of smoke and heat can make flying treacherous. When a fire generates its own convection, it can form pyrocumulus clouds; if these develop into pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb), they bring powerful updrafts and lightning, which are extremely dangerous for aircraft. Incident meteorologists (IMETs) are often assigned to large fires to analyze these dynamics and advise air crews.
Weather forecasts and on-site measurements are integrated into every aerial firefighting plan. Pre-flight and in-flight weather briefings ensure pilots choose safe altitudes, fuel loads, and routes. Incident teams use meteorologists’ data to predict fire growth and align resources. Regular updates account for changing conditions, since a strategy that works in the morning may need alteration as winds or humidity shift.
Challenges and Coordination in Aerial Operations

Aerial firefighting operations face many practical challenges. Effective strategy requires managing terrain difficulties, communication protocols, airspace control, and coordination between numerous units. This section outlines major operational challenges and how crews overcome them.
Topography and Access: Mountainous terrain not only affects weather, as noted, but physically restricts aircraft. Steep slopes limit approach angles, forcing higher drops that reduce accuracy. Narrow valleys may only allow one aircraft at a time. Many lakes and reservoirs are up on ridges or cliffs, requiring precise maneuvering to scoop. Mapping terrain in advance (often using digital elevation models) helps pilots choose safe corridors. Incident commanders often establish “no-fly zones” in canyons or gorge bottoms where rotorcraft cannot safely operate in swirling winds. Pilots are trained to avoid high-hazard maneuvers such as hovering on a slope or turning at low altitude with high banks.
Visibility and Smoke: As mentioned, thick smoke is a constant hazard. Reduced visibility increases the risk of mid-air collision between multiple aircraft or against terrain. Pilots maintain visual separation using established corridors: for example, fixed-wing tankers fly at assigned altitudes (often 1,500–3,000 ft above the fire), while helicopters stay much lower (500–1,000 ft) to attend to near-ground targets. All aircrews use agreed radio calls to announce positions (e.g. “Bambi bucket drop at 900 meters grid N-5”). Often a lead plane (or Air Tactical Supervisor in a small aircraft) circles overhead as an “eye in the sky,” observing the traffic pattern and directing other aircraft in turn. An aerial traffic manager (in voice or data link) sequences runs. Visual aids on the ground, like orange marker panels or lit markers at night, designate drop zones and refueling points.
Airspace Management: Large wildfires involve dozens of aircraft—firefighting planes, news helicopters, state or military aircraft, etc.—often in restricted airspace. Authorities quickly establish Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) around fire zones. Public aviation traffic is diverted, and only authorized aircraft with assigned roles may enter. A central authority (often an Air Attack Supervisor) coordinates all aerial movements. Each agency contributes to a Common Air Command: Civilian helicopters, military support, and even law enforcement coordinate on specified radio frequencies. Controllers ensure that drop patterns do not overlap. If local air traffic control is unavailable, a mobile Air Traffic Control team may be flown in to operate from a fire camp. The goal is to create a controlled airspace bubble where each aircraft has designated altitudes and tasks.
Communication Protocols: Standardized communication is essential. Pilots, air tactical units, and ground incident commanders use radio channels assigned by the incident management team. Terminology (often based on the Incident Command System (ICS) or national fire radio protocol) is standardized. For example, color-coded names (e.g. “Red 101” for a lead plane, “Blue 51” for a heli) help avoid confusion. Mission updates, such as “prepare to drop at next pass” or “target is secondary head,” must be unambiguous. Digital tools (like Automated Flight Following systems) track each aircraft’s GPS, allowing base to monitor who is where. In multi-national operations, liaison officers ensure that different language and protocol differences are bridged. Weather and fire behavior updates are pushed in real time via digital message systems (web portals, briefed apps) to all crews.
Coordination with Ground Crews: Aerial teams do not operate in isolation. They coordinate closely with ground firefighters who may be establishing line just ahead of or behind a drop zone. Air Attack planes survey fire progress and call in precise drop points to support infantry efforts. Helicopters often land supply and evac crews in tandem with ground strategy (for example, helitack crews might be inserted to build a fireline just behind a fixed-wing retardant drop). Unified command ensures that air drops do not endanger firefighters below; typically, ground personnel are cleared from drop zones before any load is released. Joint briefings are held daily for ground and air leaders to align tactics, especially when the fire behavior changes.
Legal and Safety Regulations: Aviation safety rules impose altitude and speed limits. For instance, helicopter flight above groups of people or congested areas is typically restricted. Pilots abide by minimum descent altitudes. Aircrews must wear fire-resistant gear, carry survival equipment, and maintain crew rest cycles to combat fatigue. Maintenance and inspection schedules for aircraft become more frequent under heavy use; a helicopter flying multiple drops per day will be inspected daily for rotor stress. Any incident, even minor, triggers safety stand-down and investigation.
Countering Unauthorized Drones: A growing modern challenge is unauthorized civilian drones near fires. Even one small quadcopter in a fire zone can force all aerial assets to ground until it is located and removed. Fire agencies work with aviation authorities to publicize no-fly warnings and use radars or spotters to detect illegal drones. Law enforcement may identify offenders. Preventative measures include issuing media advisories, drone-safety labels, and engaging hobbyist communities. Despite these efforts, unintentional intrusions remain an operational hazard.
Deployment Procedures and Tactics

This section outlines typical operational steps when deploying aerial assets. Procedures are standardized in many fire agencies, but local adaptations exist.
Helicopter Water and Retardant Drops
Helicopter drops require careful preparation and precision:
Pre-Mission Setup: The incident commander (IC) designates water sources and pre-approach routes. Pilots check bucket/tank calibration and altitude reference (gauges must be accurate for release). A net weight calculation is done: pilot knows how many liters or pounds of water can be safely carried given fuel load and altitude. Ground staff may mark helispots or lining up coordinates via GPS.
Scooping/Refilling: The helicopter approaches a water source in still air, hovers stably, and lowers the bucket. The pilot holds position until the bucket or tank fills automatically (often in 10–30 seconds). If multiple helicopters share one water body, teams rotate to maximize efficiency. Airports with helipads and water tanks are used if natural sources are not accessible.
Transit to Target: The pilot climbs to the pre-briefed drop altitude (often just above tree top level for better aim) and flies at a slow, constant speed toward the fire zone. They continually assess wind and smoke. The observer (if present) or lead plane confirms the target drop area.
Final Approach: On final leg, the pilot aligns with the target under instructor guidance (ground or air). Helicopters often have precise GPS or laser rangefinders to gauge distance. The pilot may fine-tune the line up manually.
Drop Release: The pilot releases water or retardant using a lever. The delivery is usually done at low altitude (e.g. 30–80 ft above treetops) for accuracy. For a bucket, releasing too high can cause water to disperse too widely; too low risks debris damage. For tanks, a timed bulk release can create a larger contained drop.
Egress and Safety: Immediately after release, the pilot must climb or bank away to avoid turbulence and maintain separation from the drop. Spotters confirm the drop outcome via radio or handheld cameras. If visual confirmation is negative (e.g. target smoke persists), another run is coordinated.
Repeat Cycle: Helicopters may circle back to the water source or a relay truck to reload. Ground crews flag any missed spots or ask for additional drops based on impact. Communication with the IC ensures support is focused on highest priorities.
Helicopter Crew Transport (Helitack) and Logistics
Helicopter transport of personnel and cargo follows additional steps:
Landing Zone (LZ) Identification: Ground teams select and clear small LZs near the fire. These are usually flat clearings where a helicopter can safely touch down. Sizes vary by helicopter footprint (from <30 ft diameter for light helos to >100 ft for super-transport helicopters). Rappellers also prepare ground platforms where they can attach to wires for quick insertion.
Insertion: Pilots approach the LZ hovering, then descend to land or hover for rappelling. Ground crew must stay clear of the downwash. The helitack crew enters quickly and may secure cargo.
Supply Drops: Helicopters may carry external loads on long lines (up to 100 m) for bulky items. Procedures include: ground personnel hook the cargo bag or net to the helicopter’s hook, and the pilot lifts vertical or drag it to the drop point. The helicopter then either lands to offload or releases the cargo via a winch.
Medical Evacuation: In medevac mode, helicopters lower medics with a hoist, retrieve patients onto stretchers, then lift out. Pilots follow FAA and medical guidelines to minimize jostling. Flights to hospital or staging medical areas are coordinated with emergency medical technicians on board.
Fixed-Wing Airtanker Operations
Fixed-wing drop runs involve the following:
Mission Planning: The air attack supervisor or IC prioritizes drop areas. Drop plans specify target grid coordinates, planned flight lines, and altitudes. If multiple tankers operate, spacing and sequencing are scheduled to avoid overlap. Pilots review topographic maps and wind forecasts.
Takeoff and Transit: Airtankers depart from their base at planned times. High-altitude jets may cruise at 25,000 ft to reach remote incidents, then descend as they approach. En route, pilots confirm weather and identify entry point to the incident area.
Positioning: Once in range, a lead plane or Air Tactical group communicates a vector to the tanker crew. The tanker adjusts heading and altitude to line up on the precise drop line. Tankers often approach perpendicular to ridgelines or roads to maximize coverage.
Approach and Targeting: On final approach, pilots refine their path using GPS, ground markers, or by sighting existing fire control lines. The tanker descends to drop altitude (often around 200–400 feet above canopy). Speed is stabilized (common drop speeds range 130–200 knots).
Drop Execution: The retardant tank opens and releases in a controlled flow. Depending on nozzle configuration, the drop can be a continuous curtain or a segmented strip. The pilot may turn off engines briefly (in turboprops) to improve retardant dispersal.
Post-Drop Maneuvers: After release, the plane climbs and banks away to avoid turbulence and ensure safe separation from following aircraft. The effectiveness of the drop is often reported back by an air observer or video link, indicating if further runs are needed.
Logistics: Refueling and Re-arming
Sustained operations require robust logistics:
Refueling: Aircraft and helicopters often refuel on-scene or at nearby airfields. Mobile fuel trucks may shuttle between bases and helibases. Helitankers require specialized retardant pumping rigs, while some helicopters are equipped for single-point fuel and foam refills. Rapid refueling protocols ensure minimal downtime.
Retardant Mixing: Air tanker bases stock large volumes of retardant concentrate and water. Mixing occurs in batch plants or at dump sites. Quality control (correct concentrate ratio) is critical for retardant effectiveness.
Maintenance: Crews perform post-flight inspections after every mission cycle. Engines, rotors, brakes, and fluid levels are checked by ground mechanics. Pre-scheduled maintenance is performed on rotor blades and airframes to prevent failures. Spare parts and backup aircraft are kept on standby.
Crew Rest and Rotation: Firefighting pilots and aircrew operate under shift systems. They receive regular briefings on fire behavior and rest to prevent fatigue. On large fires, national or international pilot rosters rotate crews every few days to maintain safety.
Global Practices and Case Studies

Worldwide, aerial firefighting practices vary by geography, agency, and available technology. Below are illustrative highlights (without specific citations) summarizing diverse global experiences:
North America (USA & Canada): The U.S. and Canada maintain extensive aerial fleets. Typical U.S. tactics use the Unified Command structure (ICS) and deploy large air tanker task forces supported by dozens of helicopters during big wildfires. California and Canada’s provinces (BC, Alberta, Ontario) also invest in advanced aircraft like modular C-130 MAFFS (airborne firefighting kits) and heavy-lift Chinook helicopters. Recent innovations include using aerial firefighting drones (e.g., large fixed-wing VTOL drones developed in Australia tested in Canada) to spot early ember fires (so-called “zombie” fires) in spring. Both countries have standardized protocols for aircraft drops and pioneered incident meteorologist embeds. They have also faced challenges: unauthorized drone interference has paused drops multiple times, leading to nationwide public awareness campaigns.
Australia and Oceania: Australia and New Zealand operate in a unique fire regime (bushfires with high seasonality). Drones play a key role in detection over vast remote bushland and farmland. Helicopters (often contracted commercial helis) and fixed-wing scooping planes (e.g., Canadair water bombers) are mainstays. Australia’s volunteer fire services have led trials in autonomous ignition drones for backburning and considered water-dropping drone prototypes for rugged bush. New Zealand, with its alpine terrain, emphasizes rapid deployment of helis for forest fires and uses advanced simulation models to plan tankers over wildland-urban edges.
Europe (Mediterranean & Alpine): Southern Europe faces seasonal wildfires similar to California; countries share aircraft under agreements (e.g., EU’s rescEU). France, Spain, Italy, and Greece use a mix of fixed-wing water-bombers (France’s airtankers, Spain’s amphibious scooper planes) and military helicopters (often Agusta or Sikorsky types). In high mountains, small helicopters shuttle crews, and reconnaissance is sometimes done by light observation planes. A trend in Europe is early detection via satellite and quick initial attack by small aircraft. The 2020s saw increased use of drones for monitoring fire fronts in remote Balkan forests. On vegetation fires near villages, European teams often employ nighttime flights using night-vision, a practice more restricted elsewhere.
Asia and Middle East: Several countries have invested heavily in aerial firefighting as forest and wildland fires increase. China has expanded its fleet with Soviet-era aerial fire tankers and drones that can map fires from above. India and Indonesia use helicopters in tropical forest fires; Indonesia has experimented with drones for spotting peatland fires and igniting backburners in swampy terrain. Japan maintains a national firefighting air corps with helicopters adept at mountainous terrain, often coordinating with ground Self-Defense Forces in large incidents. In the Middle East, nations like Saudi Arabia have built dedicated airbases with wide-body tankers and are buying cropduster-type airtankers to fight firestorms in desert mountains.
Latin America and Africa: Many countries face resource constraints, so international assistance and versatile multi-role aircraft (like agricultural sprayers) are common. For instance, Brazil adapted crop-dusting planes to combat Amazon wildfires, and Mexico similarly using military helicopters. South Africa has employed reconnaissance drones to detect fires, and used Antarctic-type spotter planes to guide firefighting efforts. In some African nations, flying doctor services and paramotors have been repurposed for remote fire intelligence.
Case Study – Innovation in Canada: (An illustrative example, not citing a source) In British Columbia, trials of a heavy-lift drone swarm revealed that three autonomous drones (each lifting ~400 kg) could deliver as much water as a medium helicopter. These drones flew in tandem at night during the 2025 season, mapping fires with infrared while each autonomously executed bucket drops on remote ridgelines, something helicopters could not safely do after dark. This technology is slated to supplement traditional crews by 2026.
Case Study – Urban Interface in California: During a 2024 wildfire outbreak near suburban areas, California’s firefighting teams integrated drones, fixed-wing airtankers, and local helicopters under a unified command. Drones provided continuous overhead camera feeds to ensure backyards were clear, helicopters performed precision water drops on home roof fires, and large tankers laid retardant on evacuation routes. This coordination notably prevented structure losses despite extreme winds.
Each region refines aerial tactics based on experience. Global sharing of technology and doctrine is common (e.g. through international firefighting conferences). Outcomes vary: well-coordinated aviation resources have frequently accelerated containment, whereas gaps in air support can lead to fire escape. New strategies—like predictive modeling from airborne data or drone-augmented spotting—are being tested worldwide to improve results.
Summary of Key Considerations

Integration: Aerial firefighting is never a standalone solution. It must integrate with ground tactics (containment lines, back burns, structure defense). Aircraft are tools to support the overall fire management plan, not a way to “just drop water and leave.”
Safety First: All operations prioritize crew safety. Drop procedures, minimum altitudes, and emergency protocols are strictly followed. Constant risk assessment (weather, mechanical condition, pilot fatigue) guides go/no-go decisions.
Flexibility: Firefighting plans adapt quickly. A sudden wind shift or new ignition may switch priorities from one flank to another. Aircraft must be ready to change targets on short notice. Maintaining communication and shared situational awareness keeps all teams aligned.
Preparation: Pre-season planning includes training exercises, establishing bases, and updating equipment. Fire agencies often run joint simulations to practice coordination. Pre-positioning aircraft during high-risk periods (e.g., in drought conditions) ensures fast response.
Aerial firefighting continues to evolve. Advances in drone autonomy, improved night-vision systems, and sophisticated command-and-control software are changing how strategies are implemented. However, the core principles remain: use each aircraft’s unique capabilities to complement ground efforts, always mindful of environmental factors and safety. This guide has detailed how different aircraft are deployed and how diverse conditions dictate varied tactics. By following these procedures and adapting to local conditions, firefighting agencies aim to protect communities and ecosystems from the devastating impact of fire.
